<h2 id="Why-You-Should-Use-Video-Hosting-Service"><a href="#Why-You-Should-Use-Video-Hosting-Service" class="headerlink" title="Why You Should Use Video Hosting Service?"></a>Why You Should Use Video Hosting Service?</h2><p>If you intend to host videos on your website, prepare for a myriad of challenges. Hosting videos on one’s website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.</p>
<p>These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.</p>
<p>Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To avoid file format hurdle</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.</p>
<p>Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storage Space and File Size Limitations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.</p>
<p>It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that’s above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantage of the Already Huge Traffic</strong></li>
</ul>

All video hosting service providers have an auto video suggestion feature. Your videos will get views courtesy of traffic from other videos. The more it’s viewed, clicked and rated, the better it ranks.</p>
<p>How to rank videos is little known by video creators. Just upload your high-quality videos and watch it become among the top-ranked in your category.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Help Upload High-Quality Video</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Vimeo is an all-round site. It can, therefore, be used as a business and private video hosting site. Three accounts are at anyone’s disposal; free account paid account with plus, Pro, Business and Premium levels and partner account. It’s not as popular as YouTube but is renowned for high-quality videos.</p>
<p>File size and bandwidth are not limited but you can only upload videos of up to 500MB per week. The annual limitation is 25GB. If you want to watch free ad videos, then use the paid accounts. But the good thing with Vimeo is that ads never play between a video.</p>

<p>Not many people like the many ads but to the entrepreneurs, it’s one of the best video hosting sites for business. They promote their businesses and products and also earn from YouTube. This channel analyses videos and shows the number of viewers, social sharing and related videos.</p>

<p>Love uploaded videos as often as you can? Then, this video hosting platform is not designed for you. With a bandwidth limited to 500GB and maximum video uploads capped at 25 videos, musicians and comedians are quite disadvantaged.</p>
<p>However, if you want a video hosting site for business, Wistia is the best. To embed videos on your website, Wistia automatically generates the video code for you to copy-paste. All videos uploaded are HD (High Definition) and contain no ads on the paid plans.</p>

<p>With only four main categories- entertainment, news, sports and music, these sites aren’t as inviting as Vimeo or Youtube. Dailymotion isn’t limited to only those four categories, just a little confusion; comedy, fashion, wild game shows and live streaming are also included.</p>
<p>However, if you want to benefit from its huge traffic of 237.30 million monthly visitors, upload videos and autosuggestions will help get thousands of viewers. Dailymotion offers viewers select their favourite while allowing partners to earn from the opportunities. And when using the free version, know each video is limited to 4GB.</p>

<p>Vidyard is another online video hosting site for business with both free and paid plans.</p>
<p>The major drawback when using the free plan is the limitations on the number of videos to upload. If your website content requires more than 5 embedded videos a month, upgrade to the paid plans.

Hosting videos on one’s website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.</p>
<p>These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.</p>
<p>Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To avoid file format hurdle</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.</p>
<p>Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storage Space and File Size Limitations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.</p>
<p>It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that’s above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantage of the Already Huge Traffic</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>According to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/" >Business of Apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, there are 2 billion monthly active YouTube users. All video hosting service providers have an auto video suggestion feature. Your videos will get views courtesy of traffic from other videos. The more it’s viewed, clicked and rated, the better it ranks.</p>
<p>How to rank videos is little known by video creators. Just upload your high-quality videos and watch it become among the top-ranked in your category.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Help Upload High-Quality Video</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>To reduce video hosting expenses, free video hosting sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Wistia would be the most suitable. Before you can make select a site, there are important factors that need to be considered.</p>
<p>Here are the best sites and their features;</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-Video-Hosting-Sites-Services-Platforms-1"><a href="#Best-Free-Video-Hosting-Sites-Services-Platforms-1" class="headerlink" title="Best Free Video Hosting Sites&#x2F;Services&#x2F;Platforms"></a>Best Free Video Hosting Sites&#x2F;Services&#x2F;Platforms</h2><p>A number of sites have been offering video hosting services for free overwhelming.

<p>Vimeo is an all-round site. It can, therefore, be used as a business and private video hosting site. Three accounts are at anyone’s disposal; free account paid account with plus, Pro, Business and Premium levels and partner account. It’s not as popular as YouTube but is renowned for high-quality videos.</p>
<p>File size and bandwidth are not limited but you can only upload videos of up to 500MB per week. The annual limitation is 25GB. If you want to watch free ad videos, then use the paid accounts. But the good thing with Vimeo is that ads never play between a video.</p>

<p>With over 500hours of video uploaded to YouTube per minute, 5 billion videos watched every day and at least 1.3 billion registered users, we all can bet it the most popular and preferred video hosting platform. YouTube is owned by Google and is the world’s second-ranked social platform with 27.80 Billion monthly visitors.</p>
<p>Not many people like the many ads but to the entrepreneurs, it’s one of the best video hosting sites for business. They promote their businesses and products and also earn from YouTube. This channel analyses videos and shows the number of viewers, social sharing and related videos.</p>
<p>Verify your account and upload videos of any format of up to 128GB. To watch videos free of ads, subscribe for the premium account. As a free unlimited video hosting site, file size and bandwidth are unlimited but videos cannot exceed 15 minutes</p>

<p>Love uploaded videos as often as you can? Then, this video hosting platform is not designed for you. With a bandwidth limited to 500GB and maximum video uploads capped at 25 videos, musicians and comedians are quite disadvantaged.</p>
<p>However, if you want a video hosting site for business, Wistia is the best. To embed videos on your website, Wistia automatically generates the video code for you to copy-paste. All videos uploaded are HD (High Definition) and contain no ads on the paid plans.</p>
<p>While many sites are non-interactive, Wistia allows video creators to interact and track leads using Mailchimp, HubSpot, Marketo and Pardot platforms. You can also engage your viewers on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

                ></p>
<p>With only four main categories- entertainment, news, sports and music, these sites aren’t as inviting as Vimeo or Youtube. Dailymotion isn’t limited to only those four categories, just a little confusion; comedy, fashion, wild game shows and live streaming are also included.</p>
<p>However, if you want to benefit from its huge traffic of 237.30 million monthly visitors, upload videos and autosuggestions will help get thousands of viewers. Dailymotion offers viewers select their favourite while allowing partners to earn from the opportunities. And when using the free version, know each video is limited to 4GB.</p>

<p>Vidyard is another online video hosting site for business with both free and paid plans.</p>
<p>The major drawback when using the free plan is the limitations on the number of videos to upload. If your website content requires more than 5 embedded videos a month, upgrade to the paid plans.

Hosting videos on one’s website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.</p>
<p>These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.</p>
<p>Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To avoid file format hurdle</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.</p>
<p>Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storage Space and File Size Limitations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.</p>
<p>It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that’s above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantage of the Already Huge Traffic</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>To reduce video hosting expenses, free video hosting sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Wistia would be the most suitable. Before you can make select a site, there are important factors that need to be considered.</p>
<p>Here are the best sites and their features;</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-Video-Hosting-Sites-Services-Platforms-2"><a href="#Best-Free-Video-Hosting-Sites-Services-Platforms-2" class="headerlink" title="Best Free Video Hosting Sites&#x2F;Services&#x2F;Platforms"></a>Best Free Video Hosting Sites&#x2F;Services&#x2F;Platforms</h2><p>A number of sites have been offering video hosting services for free overwhelming.

<p>Vimeo is an all-round site. It can, therefore, be used as a business and private video hosting site. Three accounts are at anyone’s disposal; free account paid account with plus, Pro, Business and Premium levels and partner account. It’s not as popular as YouTube but is renowned for high-quality videos.</p>
<p>File size and bandwidth are not limited but you can only upload videos of up to 500MB per week. The annual limitation is 25GB. If you want to watch free ad videos, then use the paid accounts. But the good thing with Vimeo is that ads never play between a video.</p>

<p>With over 500hours of video uploaded to YouTube per minute, 5 billion videos watched every day and at least 1.3 billion registered users, we all can bet it the most popular and preferred video hosting platform. YouTube is owned by Google and is the world’s second-ranked social platform with 27.80 Billion monthly visitors.</p>
<p>Not many people like the many ads but to the entrepreneurs, it’s one of the best video hosting sites for business. They promote their businesses and products and also earn from YouTube. This channel analyses videos and shows the number of viewers, social sharing and related videos.</p>
<p>Verify your account and upload videos of any format of up to 128GB. To watch videos free of ads, subscribe for the premium account. As a free unlimited video hosting site, file size and bandwidth are unlimited but videos cannot exceed 15 minutes</p>

<p>Love uploaded videos as often as you can? Then, this video hosting platform is not designed for you. With a bandwidth limited to 500GB and maximum video uploads capped at 25 videos, musicians and comedians are quite disadvantaged.</p>
<p>However, if you want a video hosting site for business, Wistia is the best. To embed videos on your website, Wistia automatically generates the video code for you to copy-paste. All videos uploaded are HD (High Definition) and contain no ads on the paid plans.</p>
<p>While many sites are non-interactive, Wistia allows video creators to interact and track leads using Mailchimp, HubSpot, Marketo and Pardot platforms. You can also engage your viewers on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

                ></p>
<p>With only four main categories- entertainment, news, sports and music, these sites aren’t as inviting as Vimeo or Youtube. Dailymotion isn’t limited to only those four categories, just a little confusion; comedy, fashion, wild game shows and live streaming are also included.</p>
<p>However, if you want to benefit from its huge traffic of 237.30 million monthly visitors, upload videos and autosuggestions will help get thousands of viewers. Dailymotion offers viewers select their favourite while allowing partners to earn from the opportunities. And when using the free version, know each video is limited to 4GB.</p>
<p>Among the video hosting sites here, this site is less restrictive and easy to share videos to the social media channels. Categorization of the videos offers easy access to ones desired videos.</p>

<p>Vidyard is another online video hosting site for business with both free and paid plans.</p>
<p>The major drawback when using the free plan is the limitations on the number of videos to upload. If your website content requires more than 5 embedded videos a month, upgrade to the paid plans.

Hosting videos on one’s website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.</p>
<p>These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.</p>
<p>Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To avoid file format hurdle</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.</p>
<p>Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storage Space and File Size Limitations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.</p>
<p>It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that’s above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.</p>

<p>To reduce video hosting expenses, free video hosting sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Wistia would be the most suitable. Before you can make select a site, there are important factors that need to be considered.</p>
<p>Here are the best sites and their features;</p>

<p>Vimeo is an all-round site. It can, therefore, be used as a business and private video hosting site. Three accounts are at anyone’s disposal; free account paid account with plus, Pro, Business and Premium levels and partner account. It’s not as popular as YouTube but is renowned for high-quality videos.</p>
<p>File size and bandwidth are not limited but you can only upload videos of up to 500MB per week. The annual limitation is 25GB. If you want to watch free ad videos, then use the paid accounts. But the good thing with Vimeo is that ads never play between a video.</p>

<p>With over 500hours of video uploaded to YouTube per minute, 5 billion videos watched every day and at least 1.3 billion registered users, we all can bet it the most popular and preferred video hosting platform. YouTube is owned by Google and is the world’s second-ranked social platform with 27.80 Billion monthly visitors.</p>
<p>Not many people like the many ads but to the entrepreneurs, it’s one of the best video hosting sites for business. They promote their businesses and products and also earn from YouTube. This channel analyses videos and shows the number of viewers, social sharing and related videos.</p>
<p>Verify your account and upload videos of any format of up to 128GB. To watch videos free of ads, subscribe for the premium account. As a free unlimited video hosting site, file size and bandwidth are unlimited but videos cannot exceed 15 minutes</p>

<p>Love uploaded videos as often as you can? Then, this video hosting platform is not designed for you. With a bandwidth limited to 500GB and maximum video uploads capped at 25 videos, musicians and comedians are quite disadvantaged.</p>
<p>However, if you want a video hosting site for business, Wistia is the best. To embed videos on your website, Wistia automatically generates the video code for you to copy-paste. All videos uploaded are HD (High Definition) and contain no ads on the paid plans.</p>
<p>While many sites are non-interactive, Wistia allows video creators to interact and track leads using Mailchimp, HubSpot, Marketo and Pardot platforms. You can also engage your viewers on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

                ></p>
<p>With only four main categories- entertainment, news, sports and music, these sites aren’t as inviting as Vimeo or Youtube. Dailymotion isn’t limited to only those four categories, just a little confusion; comedy, fashion, wild game shows and live streaming are also included.</p>
<p>However, if you want to benefit from its huge traffic of 237.30 million monthly visitors, upload videos and autosuggestions will help get thousands of viewers. Dailymotion offers viewers select their favourite while allowing partners to earn from the opportunities. And when using the free version, know each video is limited to 4GB.</p>
<p>Among the video hosting sites here, this site is less restrictive and easy to share videos to the social media channels. Categorization of the videos offers easy access to ones desired videos.</p>

<p>Vidyard is another online video hosting site for business with both free and paid plans.</p>
<p>The major drawback when using the free plan is the limitations on the number of videos to upload. If your website content requires more than 5 embedded videos a month, upgrade to the paid plans.

<ul>
<li>Starting with the simple interface that includes an array of features to distinguish as a sophisticated video editing tool for Mac.</li>
<li>The regular addition of new features like Auto Reframe to smartly crop your video and integration of the cloud-based stock library are what make this software powerful and superior</li>
<li>Plus, you can choose the presets and edit up to 4K videos at 60fps. The drag-and-drop feature allows you to add media files, and the preview section lets you see the edited video in real-time.</li>
<li>The timeline is simple yet powerful, and the customizable settings allow you to use the combination of mouse, keyboard, and icons controls and make the video-editing process seamless.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, it is not tough to discern why Filmora is considered as one of the most authoritative <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor for Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> users.

<h2 id="Part-2-Top-3-VSDC-Video-Editor-for-Mac-Alternatives"><a href="#Part-2-Top-3-VSDC-Video-Editor-for-Mac-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Top 3 VSDC Video Editor for Mac Alternatives"></a>Part 2: Top 3 VSDC Video Editor for Mac Alternatives</h2><p>After reviewing hundreds of freeware software, we have come up with the three best VSDC alternatives.</p>
<h3 id="1-ShotCut"><a href="#1-ShotCut" class="headerlink" title="1. ShotCut"></a>1. ShotCut</h3><p>A simple, free, and open-source software that makes the video-making process straightforward. Filled with interesting ideas and powerful features, the greatest thing about ShotCut is that besides being free — it is regularly updated and maintained by the vendor. The interface has a three-panel view and adding media files is as simple as dragging and dropping.</p>
<p>The software also includes rich features like keyframing, color correction, transition and lets you edit up to 4K resolution video with ease. But unlike VSDC, ShotCut does not have multiple preset transition effects and includes only 24 basic wipe-in or out effects. Still, the software has sophisticated features like Chroma Key and allows you to utilize third-party addons for text and titles as the application does not have many of them.</p>

                      alt="shortcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight for a sophisticated video-editor</li>
<li>The interface is simple and convenient and allows you to customize the toggles as per your preference</li>
<li>Numerous output options — supports major formats and offers you to export the footage in any format</li>
<li>Completely free platforms plus cross-platform support</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The app does not allow you to create layers automatically.</li>
<li>It could be tough for a newbie to work on ShotCut.</li>
<li>The application takes too long to show the applied effects; even simple transition effects suffer from latency.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-OpenShot"><a href="#2-OpenShot" class="headerlink" title="2. OpenShot"></a>2. OpenShot</h3><p>Another free and open-source program, OpenShot, has the ability to give you high-quality output with minimal effort. The software includes all the basic functions like resizing, scaling, trimming, and audio mixing with real-time previews. Plus, it also incorporates features for animated-based keyframing and creating 2D animation with image sequencing.</p>
<p>Moreover, like the VSDC, there are also presets to give 3D effects like snowfall, text, and lens flares, and other effects to the video. Nonetheless, if you want to take these into your hand and need more flexibility over transition, effects, filters, and more then you will have to look elsewhere. Because although great, OpenShot does have gaps and excludes critical features, meaning if you want to give artistic effects and personalize the video as much as possible, OpenShot is not suitable for you.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="openshot"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OpenShot user-friendly, intuitive interface enables users to utilize all the editing functions effortlessly.</li>
<li>The dedicated preview-video section allows you to view the edited video in real-time and see if everything is done perfectly or not.</li>
<li>Includes some basic 2D and 3D transition, plus it also includes filters and effects.</li>
<li>Audio equalizer lets you work on every aspect of the audio and tune the music finely.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many users have criticized the OpenShot video editor for lagging and crashing issues while editing high-resolution videos</li>
<li>Even after multiple requests from the users, OpenShot does not support GPU acceleration for encoding and decoding the video files.</li>
<li>Some critical features are missing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-Avidemux"><a href="#3-Avidemux" class="headerlink" title="3. Avidemux"></a>3. Avidemux</h3><p>Like VSDC, Avidemux is also a freeware that includes all the basic options to edit the video and is much suitable for beginner-level users. However, if you are intermediate or expert in video editing, Avidemux is not the one you need. The reason: Avidemux does have basic options like cutting, trimming, splitting, and more. Still, when it comes to sophisticated features like creative effects, transition, Avidemux does not have dedicated functions for that. Moreover, as usual for the video editors, the Timeline feature is also missing from the software.</p>
<p>Of course, in comparison to VSDC, Avidemux falls short. Because all it can do is the basic video editing, encoding, and de-noising. Other than that, it cannot boast about anything. Still, given the simple interface, Avidemux is perfect for newbies who do not have much experience with video editing. Be that as it may, if you are serious regarding video-editing, you should get a more powerful video editor on Mac.</p>

<ul>
<li>The simple interface allows even the naivest users to use the application to the fullest</li>
<li>The application has all the basic video-editing features like cutting, splitting, trimming</li>
<li>Avidemux is excellent for encoding options; one of the industry’s finest, in fact.</li>
<li>Sharpening and de-noising filters to give fine details to the video</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avidemux does not have advanced video-editing options like effects and transition</li>
<li>Lack the much important timeline feature</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part-3-Final-Words"><a href="#Part-3-Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Final Words"></a>Part 3: Final Words</h2><p>VSDC is a powerful and unique tool. The above-listed freeware like ShotCut, OpenShot, and Avidemux are good alternatives to it. But after reviewing several video editors — this is the closest we came to finding something similar to VSDC. And understanding that Mac users will need all the powerful functions that VSDC incorporates, Filmora for Mac that includes everything that VSDC has and more! The Filmora for Mac is also free to utilize, so you can simply download the software and edit videos like professionals.</p>

<h3 id="1-ShotCut-2"><a href="#1-ShotCut-2" class="headerlink" title="1. ShotCut"></a>1. ShotCut</h3><p>A simple, free, and open-source software that makes the video-making process straightforward. Filled with interesting ideas and powerful features, the greatest thing about ShotCut is that besides being free — it is regularly updated and maintained by the vendor. The interface has a three-panel view and adding media files is as simple as dragging and dropping.</p>
<p>The software also includes rich features like keyframing, color correction, transition and lets you edit up to 4K resolution video with ease. But unlike VSDC, ShotCut does not have multiple preset transition effects and includes only 24 basic wipe-in or out effects. Still, the software has sophisticated features like Chroma Key and allows you to utilize third-party addons for text and titles as the application does not have many of them.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight for a sophisticated video-editor</li>
<li>The interface is simple and convenient and allows you to customize the toggles as per your preference</li>
<li>Numerous output options — supports major formats and offers you to export the footage in any format</li>
<li>Completely free platforms plus cross-platform support</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The app does not allow you to create layers automatically.</li>
<li>It could be tough for a newbie to work on ShotCut.</li>
<li>The application takes too long to show the applied effects; even simple transition effects suffer from latency.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-OpenShot-2"><a href="#2-OpenShot-2" class="headerlink" title="2. OpenShot"></a>2. OpenShot</h3><p>Another free and open-source program, OpenShot, has the ability to give you high-quality output with minimal effort. The software includes all the basic functions like resizing, scaling, trimming, and audio mixing with real-time previews. Plus, it also incorporates features for animated-based keyframing and creating 2D animation with image sequencing.</p>
<p>Moreover, like the VSDC, there are also presets to give 3D effects like snowfall, text, and lens flares, and other effects to the video. Nonetheless, if you want to take these into your hand and need more flexibility over transition, effects, filters, and more then you will have to look elsewhere. Because although great, OpenShot does have gaps and excludes critical features, meaning if you want to give artistic effects and personalize the video as much as possible, OpenShot is not suitable for you.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OpenShot user-friendly, intuitive interface enables users to utilize all the editing functions effortlessly.</li>
<li>The dedicated preview-video section allows you to view the edited video in real-time and see if everything is done perfectly or not.</li>
<li>Includes some basic 2D and 3D transition, plus it also includes filters and effects.</li>
<li>Audio equalizer lets you work on every aspect of the audio and tune the music finely.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many users have criticized the OpenShot video editor for lagging and crashing issues while editing high-resolution videos</li>
<li>Even after multiple requests from the users, OpenShot does not support GPU acceleration for encoding and decoding the video files.</li>
<li>Some critical features are missing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-Avidemux-2"><a href="#3-Avidemux-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Avidemux"></a>3. Avidemux</h3><p>Like VSDC, Avidemux is also a freeware that includes all the basic options to edit the video and is much suitable for beginner-level users. However, if you are intermediate or expert in video editing, Avidemux is not the one you need. The reason: Avidemux does have basic options like cutting, trimming, splitting, and more. Still, when it comes to sophisticated features like creative effects, transition, Avidemux does not have dedicated functions for that. Moreover, as usual for the video editors, the Timeline feature is also missing from the software.</p>
<p>Of course, in comparison to VSDC, Avidemux falls short. Because all it can do is the basic video editing, encoding, and de-noising. Other than that, it cannot boast about anything. Still, given the simple interface, Avidemux is perfect for newbies who do not have much experience with video editing. Be that as it may, if you are serious regarding video-editing, you should get a more powerful video editor on Mac.</p>

<li>Sharpening and de-noising filters to give fine details to the video</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avidemux does not have advanced video-editing options like effects and transition</li>
<li>Lack the much important timeline feature</li>

Even if your Chromebook supports Android apps it is possible that some apps cannot work properly on a Chromebook. Installing apps from a Google Play Store can at times be a somewhat complicated process so let’s go through it step by step.</p>
<h4 id="Step-1-Getting-the-Google-Play-Store-App-3"><a href="#Step-1-Getting-the-Google-Play-Store-App-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Getting the Google Play Store App"></a>Step 1 Getting the Google Play Store App</h4><p>The process of acquiring the Google Play Store app is different for Chromebooks that support Android app and for those that don’t. It is of utmost importance to make sure that the OS you have on your Chromebook is at least version 53 or more recent, otherwise, you will not be able to get the Google Play Store App.</p>
<h4 id="1-If-your-Chromebook-supports-Android-apps-3"><a href="#1-If-your-Chromebook-supports-Android-apps-3" class="headerlink" title="1. If your Chromebook supports Android apps"></a>1. If your Chromebook supports Android apps</h4><p>Once you’ve made sure that your Chromebook has the OS that supports Android apps, go to Status area, and look for the Settings cog. After the Setting window opens, click on the ‘Enable Google Play Store on your Chromebook’ check box located at the bottom of the Settings window under Google Play Store (beta) option. This action will open the Google Play Store app and you will be asked to accept the terms and conditions, click <strong>Agree</strong> and proceed to download the apps you want.</p>

If your Chromebook doesn’t support Android apps"></a>2. If your Chromebook doesn’t support Android apps</h4><p>The process of gaining access to Google Play Store is more complicated if the Chromebook you have doesn’t allow its user to run Android apps. In order to start this process, you first need to switch to the Developer Channel, which has its own risks. Back up all your data, before switching to developer channel, because returning to a stable channel requires you to do a factory reset.</p>
<p>To make the switch you’ll need to go to Status area and click on Settings, this action will open the Settings page. Once the page is displayed on your screen click the About Chrome OS tab that shows which version of the OS you have installed on your Chromebook and which channel you are currently running.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="install-android-on-chromebook-settings-2"
                ></p>
<p>Click on More Info to expand the info about the Chrome OS, and look for a Change Chanel option. Clicking on the Change Chanel button will present you with three options Stable, Beta and Developer-unstable, select the last option, read the warning dialog box carefully and click Change Channel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="install-android-on-chromebook-settings-3"
                ></p>
<p>Once all the necessary updates to put the device into Developer Channel are completed, you will be required to restart your Chromebook. After you have restarted your Chromebook, go to the Apps tray and you will see that Google Play Store app is now available. Click on it and go through the Terms and Conditions and click on accept.</p>

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>The process of getting android video editing apps is simple and very similar to the installation process of an app on an Android phone. Locate the app you want to install and click on the Install button. The process will start immediately, and you may be asked to give authorizations to install the app on your Chromebook, but that’s the only action you’ll need to perform during this stage of the process. After the installation is over you’ll find your new video editing app in the App Tray, next to other apps you have on your Chromebook. Click on it to run the app and you are all set to start your first video editing journey on your Chromebook.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that how apps perform will largely depend on the Chromebook you have, so before choosing to download and install an Android video editing app, make sure that your device is capable of delivering a solid performance. Share with us about your opinion in the comment section below.</p>
