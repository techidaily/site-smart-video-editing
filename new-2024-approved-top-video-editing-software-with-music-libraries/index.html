Even though creating a well-crafted soundtrack is just as vital as having a flawlessly shot movie, most novice filmmakers and video producers overlook the fact that sound may assist them in creating a fuller and dramatic visual output. The reality is that these software applications enable artists to create cutting-edge videos.</p>
<p>These tools are adept at everything from PIP to audio addition and effects addition to general video control, with a low-cost means of creating music. When all of these effects are combined, music makers become a must-have for everyone. Continue reading this article to learn about the best <strong>Video Editor with Music</strong> that makes it easier to incorporate music into your videos!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Best-Video-Editors-with-Music-on-Windows-and-Mac"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Video-Editors-with-Music-on-Windows-and-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Video Editors with Music on Windows and Mac"></a>Part 1: Best Video Editors with Music on Windows and Mac</h2><p>Whether it’s a personal video, a promo, or a cinematic trailer, the audio or song in a video may have a significant impact on our impression of it.</p>
<p>But what if you just have muted footage or a cracked and damaged audio file that has to be repaired, and you would like to add audio to the movie right now? In such a case, you may make things easy for yourself by using the applications listed below!</p>
<h3 id="1-Windows-10-Photos-App"><a href="#1-Windows-10-Photos-App" class="headerlink" title="1  Windows 10 Photos App"></a>1  Windows 10 Photos App</h3><p><strong>Supported System</strong>: Windows 10 and Windows 11</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free</p>
<p>Microsoft or Windows Photo App, a free photo viewer and editor bundled with Windows 10, provides capable image editing and photo improvements, as well as capabilities for managing and editing video, all in a touch-friendly interface.</p>
<p>You may doodle on photographs, add background music and 3D effects to films, and use automated object tagging to make searching easier. Microsoft Photos is a wonderful tool for working with digital photographs, and for certain users, it may even replace third-party photo applications.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 Photos application’s artificial intelligence function allows you to create a video with music automatically with the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Automatic Video feature</strong></a>. It’s simple to accomplish, what’s more, there are some music track presets in the Photos app, so you can change the background music and edit it further manually.</p>
<p>Besides that, you can also create a new video project from scratch and choose music from its background music library.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Photos app, go to <strong>New video</strong> and then click <strong>New Video Project</strong> button at the top of the screen, and then rename the video accordingly.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="windows 10 photos new video project"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the <strong>+Add</strong> option to import photos or videos to the project from your PC or collection, and then drop and place them to the storyboard.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="place video image to windows 10 photos storyboard"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, from the top-right, press the <strong>Background music</strong> menu, pick one from the list. And the music track will fit to the length of the video automatically. You can enable <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Sync your video to the music’s beat</strong></a> to sync music to the beat of a video.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Then press the <strong>Done</strong> button. This is how you can use the Windows Photos App and add a soundtrack from its background music library to videos. Windows 10 has several benefits, and with the correct tools, you can get the most out of it.</p>
<h3 id="2-Apple-iMovie"><a href="#2-Apple-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="2  Apple iMovie"></a>2  Apple iMovie</h3><p><strong>Supported System</strong>: macOS, iOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free</p>
<p>Apple’s entry-level desktop video editing software can transform your video and photographs into professional-looking creations. However, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Apple’s video editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> hasn’t evolved much in the last several years.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it still outperforms what you will get with Windows 10, which would be limited to the (albeit increasing) video capabilities integrated within Windows’ Photos app.</p>
<p>In your digital films, Apple iMovie contains superb capabilities for media management, color grading, speed, green-screen effects, narration, and music.</p>
<p>It isn’t always the first to support new formats—<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >360-degree video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is currently unavailable, but it supports 4K. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Trailers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Movies are two of the greatest storyboard-based movie-making features for beginners in iMovie.</p>
<p>For beginner-level video editing, Apple iMovie is an excellent choice. For background sound, the iMovie creator integrates with iTunes and GarageBand, and you may choose from a good range of background soundtracks and audio effects, such as four pitch levels, cosmic, and robot.</p>
<p>The Reduce Background Noise option, on the other hand, is controlled by a slider. Follow these steps to add music to your videos using iMovie:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click the <strong>Add Media</strong> button while your application is visible in the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To access the built-in music, go to <strong>Audio</strong>, then <strong>Soundtracks</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To hear a sample of a soundtrack, press it. If a soundtrack is muted, press it to download it first, then tap it again to listen to it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap the <strong>Add Audio</strong> button near a soundtrack to include it in your composition. iMovie sets the music at the start of the project and instantly adjusts it to the project’s duration.</p>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Ideal for designing simple 3D animations and models.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: It has an old-fashioned interface. Also, the built-render (RenderMan) feature is difficult to use by beginners.</p>
<p>K-3D is an animation and 3D modeling software. You can download this tool for free on your Mac. Besides, you can also install and run it on your Windows and Linux systems. If you look at the design, you will find that the software is quite old. But don’t judge a book by its cover. Why so? It is because K-3D is one of the strongest and most versatile tools for 3D artists with many options.</p>
<p>For example, K-3D offers extremely systematic and methodological workflows. You can easily adjust the properties of the features in real-time and get instant results. It has a node-oriented visualization pipeline to enjoy more freedom. That means you can create animation using a variety of combinations.</p>
<p>One of the best things about K-3D is that it has three subdivisions of animation. You can work on your model on one side while showing the other side in a mirrored form. Then, experience the final result combined together. And in case you need to make the changes to the end results, you can simply work on the first subdivision and savor automatic changes to the results.</p>
<p>K-3D has an advanced redo and undo mechanism to ensure you can go back or move forward to make corrections or amendments without limits. Additionally, the tool is developed keeping in mind all the industrial standards. For instance, it has complete support and integration of native RenderMan™ to its user interface. This is an excellent feature because most free animation software for Mac requires third-party render plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parametric workflow.</li>
<li>2D and 3D animation tools.</li>
<li>Allows Python and K3DScript scripting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Advanced tools with numerous animation options and online training material.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: Not suitable for beginners.</p>
<p>If you love 2D animation, then you’ll surely love Krita. It is entirely free software available on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Also, it offers a full platform for drawing and frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<p>The number one reason for adoring Krita is its brush library. There are more than 100 professional brushes to give you a wide range of effects. Moreover, the strokes are pretty amazing and similar to Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<p>Another great thing about Krita is the brush stabilization feature designed for shaky hands. You can add a stabilizer to your chosen brush to smoothen its flow. Besides, there’s a special Dynamic Brush tool to make animation more fun. At the same time, you can also customize your brushes through different brush engines, including filter engines, color smudge engines, and many more.</p>
<p>Apart from the basic brush options, the preloaded vector tools are next to admire. These tools help you make great comic panels. All you need to do is choose and drag the word bubble template on your canvas. Then, make changes with the anchor point to make new shapes. At the same time, you can also add text to your animation by using the text tool.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there’s a wrap-around mode to create seamless patterns and textures. That means the image or drawing makes its own references along the x-axis and y-axis. This gives you the freedom to continue painting and enjoy updates to your animation instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HDR painting.</li>
<li>PSD support.</li>
<li>Python scripting.</li>
<li>Selection and transformation tools.</li>
<li>Proper group, filter, vector, and file layer management.</li>
<li>Complete color management for extraordinary results.</li>

<p>For example, K-3D offers extremely systematic and methodological workflows. You can easily adjust the properties of the features in real-time and get instant results. It has a node-oriented visualization pipeline to enjoy more freedom. That means you can create animation using a variety of combinations.</p>
<p>One of the best things about K-3D is that it has three subdivisions of animation. You can work on your model on one side while showing the other side in a mirrored form. Then, experience the final result combined together. And in case you need to make the changes to the end results, you can simply work on the first subdivision and savor automatic changes to the results.</p>
<p>K-3D has an advanced redo and undo mechanism to ensure you can go back or move forward to make corrections or amendments without limits. Additionally, the tool is developed keeping in mind all the industrial standards. For instance, it has complete support and integration of native RenderMan™ to its user interface. This is an excellent feature because most free animation software for Mac requires third-party render plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parametric workflow.</li>
<li>2D and 3D animation tools.</li>
<li>Allows Python and K3DScript scripting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Advanced tools with numerous animation options and online training material.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: Not suitable for beginners.</p>
<p>If you love 2D animation, then you’ll surely love Krita. It is entirely free software available on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Also, it offers a full platform for drawing and frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<p>The number one reason for adoring Krita is its brush library. There are more than 100 professional brushes to give you a wide range of effects. Moreover, the strokes are pretty amazing and similar to Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<p>Another great thing about Krita is the brush stabilization feature designed for shaky hands. You can add a stabilizer to your chosen brush to smoothen its flow. Besides, there’s a special Dynamic Brush tool to make animation more fun. At the same time, you can also customize your brushes through different brush engines, including filter engines, color smudge engines, and many more.</p>
<p>Apart from the basic brush options, the preloaded vector tools are next to admire. These tools help you make great comic panels. All you need to do is choose and drag the word bubble template on your canvas. Then, make changes with the anchor point to make new shapes. At the same time, you can also add text to your animation by using the text tool.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there’s a wrap-around mode to create seamless patterns and textures. That means the image or drawing makes its own references along the x-axis and y-axis. This gives you the freedom to continue painting and enjoy updates to your animation instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HDR painting.</li>
<li>PSD support.</li>
<li>Python scripting.</li>
<li>Selection and transformation tools.</li>
<li>Proper group, filter, vector, and file layer management.</li>
<li>Complete color management for extraordinary results.</li>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Ideal for designing simple 3D animations and models.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: It has an old-fashioned interface. Also, the built-render (RenderMan) feature is difficult to use by beginners.</p>
<p>K-3D is an animation and 3D modeling software. You can download this tool for free on your Mac. Besides, you can also install and run it on your Windows and Linux systems. If you look at the design, you will find that the software is quite old. But don’t judge a book by its cover. Why so? It is because K-3D is one of the strongest and most versatile tools for 3D artists with many options.</p>
<p>For example, K-3D offers extremely systematic and methodological workflows. You can easily adjust the properties of the features in real-time and get instant results. It has a node-oriented visualization pipeline to enjoy more freedom. That means you can create animation using a variety of combinations.</p>
<p>One of the best things about K-3D is that it has three subdivisions of animation. You can work on your model on one side while showing the other side in a mirrored form. Then, experience the final result combined together. And in case you need to make the changes to the end results, you can simply work on the first subdivision and savor automatic changes to the results.</p>
<p>K-3D has an advanced redo and undo mechanism to ensure you can go back or move forward to make corrections or amendments without limits. Additionally, the tool is developed keeping in mind all the industrial standards. For instance, it has complete support and integration of native RenderMan™ to its user interface. This is an excellent feature because most free animation software for Mac requires third-party render plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parametric workflow.</li>
<li>2D and 3D animation tools.</li>
<li>Allows Python and K3DScript scripting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Advanced tools with numerous animation options and online training material.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: Not suitable for beginners.</p>
<p>If you love 2D animation, then you’ll surely love Krita. It is entirely free software available on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Also, it offers a full platform for drawing and frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<p>The number one reason for adoring Krita is its brush library. There are more than 100 professional brushes to give you a wide range of effects. Moreover, the strokes are pretty amazing and similar to Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<p>Another great thing about Krita is the brush stabilization feature designed for shaky hands. You can add a stabilizer to your chosen brush to smoothen its flow. Besides, there’s a special Dynamic Brush tool to make animation more fun. At the same time, you can also customize your brushes through different brush engines, including filter engines, color smudge engines, and many more.</p>
<p>Apart from the basic brush options, the preloaded vector tools are next to admire. These tools help you make great comic panels. All you need to do is choose and drag the word bubble template on your canvas. Then, make changes with the anchor point to make new shapes. At the same time, you can also add text to your animation by using the text tool.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there’s a wrap-around mode to create seamless patterns and textures. That means the image or drawing makes its own references along the x-axis and y-axis. This gives you the freedom to continue painting and enjoy updates to your animation instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HDR painting.</li>
<li>PSD support.</li>
<li>Python scripting.</li>
<li>Selection and transformation tools.</li>
<li>Proper group, filter, vector, and file layer management.</li>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Ideal for designing simple 3D animations and models.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: It has an old-fashioned interface. Also, the built-render (RenderMan) feature is difficult to use by beginners.</p>
<p>K-3D is an animation and 3D modeling software. You can download this tool for free on your Mac. Besides, you can also install and run it on your Windows and Linux systems. If you look at the design, you will find that the software is quite old. But don’t judge a book by its cover. Why so? It is because K-3D is one of the strongest and most versatile tools for 3D artists with many options.</p>
<p>For example, K-3D offers extremely systematic and methodological workflows. You can easily adjust the properties of the features in real-time and get instant results. It has a node-oriented visualization pipeline to enjoy more freedom. That means you can create animation using a variety of combinations.</p>
<p>One of the best things about K-3D is that it has three subdivisions of animation. You can work on your model on one side while showing the other side in a mirrored form. Then, experience the final result combined together. And in case you need to make the changes to the end results, you can simply work on the first subdivision and savor automatic changes to the results.</p>
<p>K-3D has an advanced redo and undo mechanism to ensure you can go back or move forward to make corrections or amendments without limits. Additionally, the tool is developed keeping in mind all the industrial standards. For instance, it has complete support and integration of native RenderMan™ to its user interface. This is an excellent feature because most free animation software for Mac requires third-party render plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parametric workflow.</li>
<li>2D and 3D animation tools.</li>
<li>Allows Python and K3DScript scripting.</li>

<p>If you love 2D animation, then you’ll surely love Krita. It is entirely free software available on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Also, it offers a full platform for drawing and frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<p>The number one reason for adoring Krita is its brush library. There are more than 100 professional brushes to give you a wide range of effects. Moreover, the strokes are pretty amazing and similar to Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<p>Another great thing about Krita is the brush stabilization feature designed for shaky hands. You can add a stabilizer to your chosen brush to smoothen its flow. Besides, there’s a special Dynamic Brush tool to make animation more fun. At the same time, you can also customize your brushes through different brush engines, including filter engines, color smudge engines, and many more.</p>
<p>Apart from the basic brush options, the preloaded vector tools are next to admire. These tools help you make great comic panels. All you need to do is choose and drag the word bubble template on your canvas. Then, make changes with the anchor point to make new shapes. At the same time, you can also add text to your animation by using the text tool.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there’s a wrap-around mode to create seamless patterns and textures. That means the image or drawing makes its own references along the x-axis and y-axis. This gives you the freedom to continue painting and enjoy updates to your animation instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HDR painting.</li>
<li>PSD support.</li>
<li>Python scripting.</li>
<li>Selection and transformation tools.</li>
<li>Proper group, filter, vector, and file layer management.</li>
<li>Complete color management for extraordinary results.</li>
