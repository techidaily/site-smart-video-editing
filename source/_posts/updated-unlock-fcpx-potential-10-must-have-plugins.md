The XML file consists of tags and texts. This tag contains the main elements of the file, and the text carries readable information.

Unlike HTML, the Extensible Markup Language describes the data content in a readable format without any complex codes. It is easy to understand and displays a clear illustration of the purpose. You can find the applications of XML in web publishing, to perform web tasks, and common uses like data storage, transfers.

Most users opt for XML due to its compatible features, readability, and personalization options.

For the 3D animation app, we suggest using the Bot3D Editor. It is an easy-to-use anime editor that only needs dragging to complete your editing. If you know how to use keyframes, it will give you more control over animation. For example, you can make poses in many ways by keyframes.

### 2\. How do you animate a 3D object?

The best way to animate a 3D object is by using keyframes and built-in templates. As a beginner, you may not know how to make a 3D object, but with templates, you just need to choose one and start customizing it.

### 3\. Where can I animate for free?

## Recommended 3D animation software - [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

It is true that you can make animation on your phone, but editing 3D animation on the desktop is necessary if you want to have more controls on an animation video. Here we recommend using Filmora.

You can use it to make 3D animation or 2D animation by adding [keyframes](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), so the animation will be smooth and natural. You just need to build a white plane to easily start making animation.

Besides, [color correction/grading](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and audio mixer will raise up your animation video to a new level.

## Part 3: FAQ about 3D Animation Apps

### 1\. What is the best app for animation?

For the 3D animation app, we suggest using the Bot3D Editor. It is an easy-to-use anime editor that only needs dragging to complete your editing. If you know how to use keyframes, it will give you more control over animation. For example, you can make poses in many ways by keyframes.

### 2\. How do you animate a 3D object?

The best way to animate a 3D object is by using keyframes and built-in templates. As a beginner, you may not know how to make a 3D object, but with templates, you just need to choose one and start customizing it.

### 3\. Where can I animate for free?

There are so many free-to-use animation software to use. Pencil2D is a reliable tool to make animation easy. You just need to download it on the desktop to animate objects.
