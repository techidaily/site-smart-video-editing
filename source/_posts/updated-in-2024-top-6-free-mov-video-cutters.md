If you shoot the video properly then you can keep yourself away from such issues.

This is why it becomes so important to catch the attention of your viewers immediately. Try to keep the first couple of moments exceptionally engaging.

Your subject can be placed on these lines or in between the lines where they are meeting. You can get the feature of using the grid as a guide in most of the cameras and phones.
