## Online Video Flipper: Top Tools and Software

Wondering how you can **flip videos online**? There are numerous reasons why an individual may need to flip a video. It could be because the medium they are using to post a video requires a flipped version. There are times when we think we have recorded a video horizontally, but turns out it was recorded vertically - this is where video flipping software comes in handy and helps you out!

With this online video-editing tool, you can mirror a video from left to right or turn it upside down.

In this article, you can learn the key differences between flipping and mirroring a video, what are the best **flip video online free** tools, and how to flip a video using Filmora!

#### In this article

01 [Differences Between Flip and Mirror](#part1)

02 [Best Online Video Flippers](#part2)

03 [How to Flip Video with Filmora](#part3)

## Part 1: What’s the Difference Between Flip and Mirror?

Many people believe the flip feature and mirror function in a video editing tool is the same thing. However, that is not the case - there are numerous differences. The flip function allows individuals to vertically and horizontally change the outlook of a video. On the other hand, the mirror function allows one to make changes according to the mirror reflection.

![flip video source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flip-source-image.png)

Source Video

![flipped video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filp-horizontally.jpg)

Video Flipped Horizontally

![mirrored video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrored-image.png)

Mirrored Video

For instance, if a person is working from left to right - once the video is mirrored, it will show the person walking from right to left. So, the flip function changes the portrait and landscape layout of a video, while the mirror effect changes the axis.

## Part 2: 5 Free Best Video Flipper Online
