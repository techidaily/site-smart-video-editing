**Sponsored messages in LinkedIn:** This type of LinkedIn ad was previously termed as sponsored InMail. Through this, you can directly advertise your product or brand in the user’s inbox.

One is follower ads and other is sponsored ads.

[![cut and join video clips](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/video-editor/troubleshooting.jpg)](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/video-editor/troubleshooting.jpg)

Often, instead of solving your problem, the choice of a wrong tool can cause you much more headaches, such as:

* The poor-designed user interface, the tool is very difficult to use
* Only supports running on limited Windows OS such as Windows 7, not applicable for Windows 8 and Windows 10, no Mac version
* It takes an eternity for two videos clips to be merged
* Very few video formats supported/ only videos with the same formats can be merged
* Only videos with the same aspect ratio can be merged
* Poor quality on the output/resulting file, serious loss of quality from the sourcing files
* Painful to export to multiple devices

In light of those above-mentioned reasons, it is wise for you to identify the following points before you move forward with your endeavor:

* The operation system of your computer, a Windows 7, or Windows8, Mac OS 10.10?
* The formats of your source video clips, .mp4, .avi, .flv, or any other popular formats?
* To what device you are planning to export your resulting file to/play your resulting file on?

Follow this process we are about to outline and you will have no issues with your video chopping and merging experience. It is worth mentioning that this video cutting and joining tool works on all Windows OS (Windows 10/8/7/XP/Vista), Mac OS (OS X 10.10 or later).

## Part 1: The iPhone App of the Year: [Spectre Camera](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spectre-camera/id1450074595)

Social networks have made [photography](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)more popular than ever. However, the quality of pictures taken with Smartphones still cannot be compared to the quality of images produced on [DSLR cameras](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

![Best App of the Year 2019 for iPhone - Spectre Camera   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/spectre-camera-long-exposures-app.jpg)

The iPhone app of the year provides a solution to this issue by employing the latest computational photography techniques. The Spectre Camera is equipped with an AI that can easily create long-exposure photographs, remove crowds from images and [detect scenes automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The app saves all pictures it takes during a long-exposure and generates live photos by merging all images into a single breathtaking shot.

Optionally, you can apply live effects to each image you take with Spectre Camera if you would like to enhance its colors or highlight a particular detail. [Image stabilization features](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are designed to keep all photos you shoot handheld sharp, while Spectre Camera also offers the automatic tripod detection option. The app’s machine learning algorithms detect scenes and provide all the help you need to produce professional-looking photos with your iPhone.

As the popularity of social media platforms continues to grow, so does the demand for photo and video applications that are compatible with iOS devices. That’s why it is hardly surprising that Spectre Camera is the iPhone app of the year because it is packed with industry-leading technologies that simplify the image-taking process.

Digital marketers who don’t have the skills or the time to edit their videos with professional video editing software can benefit from this AI-powered editor. In order to create a new video, you just have to choose a video editing style such as kids or pets, import the media assets into your project and let Magisto work its magic. If you opt for the monthly Business subscription plan you will gain access to more than 3 million stock videos and 25 million photos.

### 3\. [Mojo](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mojo-stories-editor/id1434861974)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:** Requires iOS 11.4 or later

![Trending Apps in 2019 for iPhone - Mojo Stories Editor ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mojo-stories-editor.jpg)

The 4.9 User Rating on more than 15.000 reviews speaks volumes about Mojo’s capabilities. Even the free version of the app lets you choose from more than a hundred fully customizable templates. So, once you pick an animated template you just have to add the video and audio files you want to include in the final version of the video and wait for Mojo to generate a new story you can share on social media. However, you must upgrade to the pro version of the app if you want to choose the aspect ratio for all videos you edit with this app or be able to use all of the text styles and templates Mojo offers.

### 4\. [Over: Design/Flyers/Story Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/over-design-flyer-story-maker/id535811906)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

In fact, if you install Over on your iPhone you can add logos, text layers and other graphic elements to photos and videos in just a few quick taps. There are hundreds of templates and fonts to choose from, and you can use any of them to design a flyer, a poster or a social media post. Sharing your creations to social networks directly from the app won’t take much more than a few moments of your time, which makes Over a perfect choice if you want to produce and share new content regularly.

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

![Trending Apps in 2019 for iPhone - Spark Camera & Video Editor ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/spark-camera-video-editor.jpg)

Apple included the Spark Camera app in their selection of the best storytelling apps in 2024, and a brief look at the app’s features shows why. Besides recording videos in Full HD and 4K resolutions you can also use Spark Camera to create voiceovers, remove any segment of a video clip you want or change a clip’s playback speed. In addition, you can set the preferred frame rate for each video you record with Spark Camera and utilize its image stabilization options while shooting under difficult light conditions. Applying a filter to a video you recorded with this app requires you to just swipe left or right while you can adjust their intensity by simply moving your finger up or down.

### 6\. [Steller](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/steller/id785128002)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:** Requires iOS 9.0 or later

![Trending Apps in 2019 for iPhone - Steller Discover·Create·Share Stories](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/steller-app-for-creating-share-stories.jpg)

It has already been five years since Steller was named as one of the best apps on the App Store by Apple, but very little has changed in the meantime. You don’t have to be a professional storyteller in order to create engaging visual stories with this app since you can select a theme you like and let Steller do all the heavy lifting for you. There just ten text styles to choose from and the app doesn’t offer even the basic video editing tools, which limits your options throughout the video editing process. Nonetheless, you can share all video content you edit with Steller directly to your Instagram Stories.

### 7\. [Unfold](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unfold-create-stories/id1247275033)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:** Requires iOS 10.0 or later

![Trending Apps in 2019 for iPhone - Unfold  Story Editor & Collage Maker  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unfold-create-stories.jpg)

Creating Facebook or Instagram Stories that attract the attention of thousands of daily viewers is what Unfold does best. You can apply ten different filters and effects to all videos you record with this app and then choose from over 150 video templates. Unfold also grants you access to advanced text tools that enable you to customize the messages you want to distribute through social media channels. The free version of Unfold offers only a limited range of options, and you must upgrade to Unfold+ if you want to access all of the themes, fonts, and stickers this app provides. Despite the great user rating, Unfold still lacks video and audio editing tools that would allow its users to manipulate their footage without any restrictions.

### 8\. [24 FPS – Video Filter & LUT](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/24fps-video-filter-lut/id1341136787)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:** Requires iOS 12.0 or later

![Trending Apps in 2019 for iPhone - 24FPS - Video Filter & LUT ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/24fps-video-filter-lut.jpg)

iPhone owners in need of a video editing app that allows them to record and edit their footage with professional tools should consider installing 24 FPS. In addition to excellent video recording capabilities, this app features a plethora of options you can use to enhance the colors in the videos you edit. Importing LUTs into 24 FPS is a routine operation that can reduce the amount of time you have to spend on giving a video a particular cinematic style. Skin-thinning and skin smoothing filters enable you to beautify the people in your videos and make them more visually appealing to the online audience. The app’s video editor also contains audio editing options that make creating a video’s soundtrack fun and enjoyable.

### 9\. [VUE – Video Camera and Editor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vue-video-camera-and-editor/id1458609369)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:** Requires iOS 9.0 or later

![Trending Apps in 2019 for iPhone - VUE - Video Camera and Editor  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vue-video-camera-and-editor.jpg)

Recording and editing social media videos from your iPhone enables you to produce visually impressive content wherever you are. An app like Vue is a perfect option if you don’t want to post unedited footage on your social media accounts, but don’t have the time to use a professional video editing software. Besides offering more than twenty filters, Vue also lets you change a video’s playback speed, merge or split multiple clips and enhance the colors of each clip you edit. The seemingly endless library of royalty-free songs offers you all the resources you are going to need while creating a soundtrack for your video, and you can also control the volume of video’s original sound and audio files you added to a project.

### 10 [1 Second Every Day: Video Diary](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1-second-everyday-video-diary/id587823548)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:** Requires iOS11.2

![Trending Apps in 2019 for iPhone - 1 Second Everyday: Video Diary](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-second-everyday-video-diary.jpg)

Simple, routine activities like capturing a single moment every day can help you create a collection of all the exciting things you do on a daily basis. 1 Second Every Day app is designed to help you create a video diary that sums up the most important moments of your day. You can either create Freestyle videos you take at different types of events and your journeys or capture standard Timeline videos that have the form of a classic video diary. The app can also auto-fill your timeline if you are struggling to find a good idea for your daily diary entry, and it supports unlimited mashing so that you can combine videos over a five-year or one-month period without any video length restrictions.

**Conclusion**

According to Apple, some of the most popular apps for the iPhone are built for storytellers, and this trend is going to continue in 2024 as the demand for video content can only increase.

![Trending Apps in 2019 for iPhone - Steller Discover·Create·Share Stories](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/steller-app-for-creating-share-stories.jpg)

It has already been five years since Steller was named as one of the best apps on the App Store by Apple, but very little has changed in the meantime.

The free version of Unfold offers only a limited range of options, and you must upgrade to Unfold+ if you want to access all of the themes, fonts, and stickers this app provides. Despite the great user rating, Unfold still lacks video and audio editing tools that would allow its users to manipulate their footage without any restrictions.

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

The app’s video editor also contains audio editing options that make creating a video’s soundtrack fun and enjoyable.

The seemingly endless library of royalty-free songs offers you all the resources you are going to need while creating a soundtrack for your video, and you can also control the volume of video’s original sound and audio files you added to a project.

### 10 [1 Second Every Day: Video Diary](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1-second-everyday-video-diary/id587823548)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

![Trending Apps in 2019 for iPhone - Steller Discover·Create·Share Stories](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/steller-app-for-creating-share-stories.jpg)

It has already been five years since Steller was named as one of the best apps on the App Store by Apple, but very little has changed in the meantime.

You can apply ten different filters and effects to all videos you record with this app and then choose from over 150 video templates. Unfold also grants you access to advanced text tools that enable you to customize the messages you want to distribute through social media channels. The free version of Unfold offers only a limited range of options, and you must upgrade to Unfold+ if you want to access all of the themes, fonts, and stickers this app provides. Despite the great user rating, Unfold still lacks video and audio editing tools that would allow its users to manipulate their footage without any restrictions.

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

Skin-thinning and skin smoothing filters enable you to beautify the people in your videos and make them more visually appealing to the online audience. The app’s video editor also contains audio editing options that make creating a video’s soundtrack fun and enjoyable.

### 9\. [VUE – Video Camera and Editor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vue-video-camera-and-editor/id1458609369)

The seemingly endless library of royalty-free songs offers you all the resources you are going to need while creating a soundtrack for your video, and you can also control the volume of video’s original sound and audio files you added to a project.

### 10 [1 Second Every Day: Video Diary](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1-second-everyday-video-diary/id587823548)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases
