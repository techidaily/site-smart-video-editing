Adjusting volume with fade in and fade out features and voice overs will benefit you in creating an exceptional audio clip to match the video you created.

 You can load the videos you captured to your pc and then directly import them to the work area or the Filmora and start editing. If not, you can directly record videos into the Filmora and do your editing by; Clicking the Record button on the upper left corner of the Media library panel and then, in the pop up Capture Video window, clicking the record to start recording and clicking it again to stop recording. After the recoding is done, click OK to save the recorded video file in the default Captured file folder.

Filters, transitions, videos enhancements tools, color adjustments and interesting text designs are available with Final Cut Pro X. This is a good software tool for a professional video editor.
