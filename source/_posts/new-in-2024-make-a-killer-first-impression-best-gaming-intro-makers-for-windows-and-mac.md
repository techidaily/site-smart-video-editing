 **Why is Audio and Video out of Sync in Final Cut Pro X?**

The audio and video out of sync is a common issue faced by most Final Cut Pro X users. They experience an audio delay in their edited video that gives a bad impression and haunts the user experience.

Whenever you face an out-of-sync problem, don’t assume that the clips in your sequence are also out of sync. Multiple factors can cause sync issues, the most prominent one is by an over-taxing of the processor when it tries to run the program at its maximum. Consequently, the overstressed processer fails to sync audio and video accordingly and causes a delay.

* Use an updated, fast, and consistent hard drive that meets the minimum software requirements of Final Cut Pro X
* Set the control panel resolution must be to 75A Hz or higher
* Do not select too many real-time audio tracks

## Part 2: How to Auto-sync in Final Cut Pro X?

## Part 1: How to Fix Audio and Video Sync Issue?

 **Why is Audio and Video out of Sync in Final Cut Pro X?**

The audio and video out of sync is a common issue faced by most Final Cut Pro X users. They experience an audio delay in their edited video that gives a bad impression and haunts the user experience.

Whenever you face an out-of-sync problem, don’t assume that the clips in your sequence are also out of sync. Multiple factors can cause sync issues, the most prominent one is by an over-taxing of the processor when it tries to run the program at its maximum. Consequently, the overstressed processer fails to sync audio and video accordingly and causes a delay.

If you are experiencing an audio and video sync problem due to an over-taxing of your computer’s processor, follow these steps to relieve processor stress and solve your problem.

* Set the Canvas size to “Fit Window”
* Prevent the Canvas and Viewer from overlapping
* Use an updated, fast, and consistent hard drive that meets the minimum software requirements of Final Cut Pro X
* Set the control panel resolution must be to 75A Hz or higher
* Do not select too many real-time audio tracks
* Turn off the Mirror to Desktop option
* Avoid opening multiple sequences simultaneously
* Render the video sequence to a single file.

## Part 2: How to Auto-sync in Final Cut Pro X?

Final Cut Pro X is an advanced and user-friendly video editing application. Its auto-sync feature automatically analyzes the audio and video clips selected in your timeline and allows you to sync video with audio.

To use this feature, use multiple audio and video clips recorded from different resources during the same take. Once you have selected, Final Cut Pro will automatically start analyzing the clips for sync points like date of file creation, markers, audio content, and time code, etc. After analyzing the clips, the syncing process will begin in which these audio and video clips will be synced together into a new clip without affecting the original clip. Even if your clips do not have any sync points, Final Cut Pro X will sync them at their respective starting points.
