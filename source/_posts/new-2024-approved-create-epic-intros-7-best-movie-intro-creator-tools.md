### 2\. Enhance your video instantly in Mac

Besides all common editing tools like crop, rotate, trim, split, add voiceover and background music, Ezivd for Mac also enables you to touch up videos by an extensive list of fabulous video edits.

For example, you can apply Mosaic to hide personal or copyrighted info, create a close-up to stand out from the crowd, adjust the playing speed like 2x faster to make fun. Let alone picking up your favorite effects from rich transitions, visual filters, intros/credits, texts, sounds, and more.

### 3\. Share the finished video with the worldwide

When you finish video editing, there are a variety of options available to export your creation. Like Ezvid, you can easily upload your masterpiece to YouTube directly from this Ezvid alternative, as well as a message to Facebook and Twitter. Or save it on the computer in **all SD and HD formats** like AVI, WMV, MOV, MKV, and so on.

More often, you’ll choose to play on portable devices like iPad, iPhone, Samsung Galaxy SIII, etc. Even burning DVD or DVD folders is included in this software for permanent preservation.
