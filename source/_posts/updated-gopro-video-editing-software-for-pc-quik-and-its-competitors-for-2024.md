## **GoPro Quik PC- An Overview**

Do you need an app for editing GoPro videos and photos? If the answer is yes, then you should go for GoPro Quik for Desktop. GoPro Quik is a video editing software that allows you to edit your GoPro videos and photos within no time. The app comes with a very simple user interface that will help you quickly edit your videos. GoPro Quik for desktop was created to meet your basic needs and wants when it comes to editing GoPro photos and videos. You can easily edit your GoPro photos and videos using this app. This app will help you in creating post-production videos like a pro.

The best thing about GoPro Quick for Desktop is that it is free to use and is available easily for both 32 bit and 64 bit systems. It also has a simple and intuitive interface that anyone can adopt, even if you don't have any prior experience with this video editing app. It basically allows you to import your GoPro clips, highlight your favorite clips, and then it edits your video for you–including adding music. The process is pretty quick, as the name suggests.

## **GoPro Quik Windows Features**

GoPro Quik app is rich with features, and it provides pretty much everything that you need to create amazing photos and videos. A few highlighting features are discussed below:

### 1.Create Amazing Videos In Just A Few Clicks

With GoPro Quik, making amazing videos is very easy. With just a few clicks, you can import all your videos and photos. Then you can edit them in just a few clicks. Everything here is so simple that you will feel like a pro video editor yourself.

### 2.Auto Cloud Uploads

Another amazing feature of GoPro Quik is that once you have done editing your videos, they will be automatically uploaded to your cloud. But for this feature to work, make sure that you have an active GoPro PLUS subscription.

### 3.Excellent editing

Simply click a few buttons to turn GoPro footage into an awesome video. Pick the perfect soundtrack, then pick your favorite moments. Your video automatically syncs with the music, so you can share it in just a few seconds. Make your videos come alive with panning effects by adding photos and time-lapse sequences.

### 4.Share with friends

Make short videos that are ideal for posting on Facebook, YouTube, and more. Make a unique video from your burst and timelapse photos. Additionally, you can find and save the most memorable moments in a video, then share them as high-quality still images.

### 5.New Speed Tool

Tap the pencil to choose the Speed icon for the video in your Media Mural. Then you can apply more than one-speed effect simultaneously. The speed can be toggled between real-time and half-speed slow motion. You can also add freeze frames for a specified period of time.

### 6.GoPro-Exclusive filters

From Media or Mural, select a photo or video and tap the pencil. In order to optimize the footage to the environment it was shot in, GoPro has created 25 filters in-house. By using the scrub bar, you can adjust the intensity of each filter.

### 7.Premium Themes

Alternatively, you may create a new highlight from Media. You will be presented with 13 video editing themes. Besides adding text and transitions, you can also change the music, choose the duration, and choose the right format for your intended sharing platform, such as social media or text.

##### Pros

Despite its ease and quickness, there are a few drawbacks to it. First, I must say this is awesome and perfect for anyone who has never edited a GoPro video before. When you're new to video editing software, it can be very easy to become frustrated and overwhelmed, so it's great for those who aren't familiar with it. It's all about getting that video off your memory card and putting it out there. That's it.

##### Cons

You cannot edit footage from your phone or DSLR with Quik App for Desktop - only GoPro footage can be used in Quik App. This is a GoPro app, after all. It should be used with GoPro content!

In addition to the ten free songs, GoPro Plus members have access to an additional song library. Users cannot import their own music either.

Additionally, you may only create a certain number of Highlights. Each 30-second video is limited to 10 Highlights.

## Final Verdict

Although GoPro Quik is amazing and comes with a lot of features, there are still many limitations of this application, as discussed in the cons section of this article. If you want to do basic editing, then this app will do just good, but if you are looking for advanced features like audio normalization, keyframing, color tuning, gif support, etc., then you will have to use another fully-fledged video editing app. We recommend you to give a try to our [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editor.

Filmora comes with plenty of features and can easily compete with the most advanced video editors in the world. The best thing is, you can download and install it for free and try all of its features without paying a penny. Also, there is an amazing community and Filmora support that you won’t find anywhere else.

## Edit M4A Files for Free: Top Software Picks

# Top 5 Best Free M4A Editor Software in 2024

![author avatar](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg)

##### Liza Brown

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Since 2007, Apple has sold their audio files on iTunes as M4A files. M4A is a high quality audio file compatible with all Apple products and software. Unfortunately, considering the audio file is relatively new and designed to work only on Apple software, most audio editors have difficulty importing the file type. There are few audio editor programs, for professional or personal use, that support the file and do so well. Despite this, it is still possible to find free audio editors that supports M4A. However, you must be careful to edit only non-copyright protected audio files. Most of these programs do not support copyrighted M4A files. That means no editing of an audio file you downloaded from the iTunes store. If you avoid copyrighted materials, these five free audio editors that allow you to edit your M4A files with little to no trouble.

### 1.[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Wondershare Filmora is a shockingly advanced free M4A compatible audio editing software. You can record audio from various sources with ease. Once you import your M4A file, you can delete, cut, copy, mix, and paste different sections of the M4A file or combine the edited file with another imported M4A file. You can also create DVDs out of the file format.

**Platform:** Windows, Mac

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 2.[AVS Audio Editor](http://www.avs4you.com/AVS-Audio-Editor.aspx)

AVS Audio Editor is an advanced free M4A compatible editing software. You can edit and save files in M4A format, which is an uncommon feature. Many programs that can edit M4A files cannot save the edited files in the same format, so AVS Audio is welcome change to the market. You also can make your audio file unique to you with 20 different effects and filters within the program. On top of all this, within the software, you can record audio in the M4A format.

**Platform:** Windows only

**Cons**: there will be a voice logo which will pop-up every 10 seconds in the free version.

![AVS Audio Editor ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/avs-audio-editor.jpg)

### 3.[Wavepad](http://www.nch.com.au/wavepad/)

Wavepad is a simple audio editor from Australia’s NCH Software. This free desktop software supports the editing and conversion of M4A audio file formats.

To edit a file, import the file into the program. You can then select sections to delete, copy, or cut. You can also add audio effects to all of or part of the audio file. Examples of the effects available on Wavepad include echo, reverberation, and normalization.

You also can convert from and to M4A with this program. The “to and fro” conversion will be especially useful to you if you need to convert your files to an iTunes friendly format.

Keep in mind that this audio editor only is free for non-commercial use. If you want to use this editor for professional or money-earning purposes, upgrade to the paid Master version of the software.

**Platform:** Windows, Mac

![Wavepad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wavepad.jpg)

### 4.[Windows Movie Maker](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-movie-maker-download)

Since its 2011 edition, Windows Movie Maker (WMM) has touted free audio editing features. You can edit a variety of audio file formats, including M4A. When you import a M4A file into Windows Movie Maker, the audio file will appear in the audio/music section of the timeline. From there, you edit the m4a file in the same manner you would edit a video on WMM. You can split, combine, and remove sections of the audio.

There are two downsides of using WMM to edit your M4A files.

One downside is that WMM will always output the audio file as a WMA. That being said, WMA files are compatible with most audio playing formats and can easily be converted into another type of audio file, so there’s no need to fret.

The second downside is that the audio editing feature, just as the program’s video editing capabilities, is limited. Not much can be done to increase the loudness or clarity of an audio file. To increase the clarity or loudness of your M4A file, you will need to utilize another audio editor.

**Platform:** Windows only

![Windows Movie Maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-movie-maker.jpg)

### 5.[DJ Audio Editor](http://www.program4pc.com/dj-audio-editor.html#page=page-1)

DJ Audio Editor is a professional-grade free M4A compatible editing software. Import the MP4 file and enjoy the editing process. As with most of the other audio editors on this list, you can apply filters and effects to parts of or all of your file. What makes this audio editor different is the addition of an audio properties editor. You can edit the metadata of each audio file, adding titles, artists, and other pieces of information. DJ Audio Editor is a free product that has a paid version. However, users who take advantage of the free software have most of the benefits paid users have. DJ Audio, despite its various amounts of features, will take up little space on your desktop. The same software company that offers this editing software also offers several other video and audio programs. These programs are also “freenium,” meaning they are free in their most basic form. Working with M4A files does not doom you to paying hundreds of dollars to get a compatible audio editor. Check out the free editors above and see which one is the best for you.

**Platform:** Windows only

Since 2007, Apple has sold their audio files on iTunes as M4A files. M4A is a high quality audio file compatible with all Apple products and software. Unfortunately, considering the audio file is relatively new and designed to work only on Apple software, most audio editors have difficulty importing the file type. There are few audio editor programs, for professional or personal use, that support the file and do so well. Despite this, it is still possible to find free audio editors that supports M4A. However, you must be careful to edit only non-copyright protected audio files. Most of these programs do not support copyrighted M4A files. That means no editing of an audio file you downloaded from the iTunes store. If you avoid copyrighted materials, these five free audio editors that allow you to edit your M4A files with little to no trouble.

### 1.[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Wondershare Filmora is a shockingly advanced free M4A compatible audio editing software. You can record audio from various sources with ease. Once you import your M4A file, you can delete, cut, copy, mix, and paste different sections of the M4A file or combine the edited file with another imported M4A file. You can also create DVDs out of the file format.

**Platform:** Windows, Mac

### 2.[AVS Audio Editor](http://www.avs4you.com/AVS-Audio-Editor.aspx)

AVS Audio Editor is an advanced free M4A compatible editing software. You can edit and save files in M4A format, which is an uncommon feature. Many programs that can edit M4A files cannot save the edited files in the same format, so AVS Audio is welcome change to the market. You also can make your audio file unique to you with 20 different effects and filters within the program. On top of all this, within the software, you can record audio in the M4A format.

**Platform:** Windows only

**Cons**: there will be a voice logo which will pop-up every 10 seconds in the free version.

![AVS Audio Editor ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/avs-audio-editor.jpg)

### 3.[Wavepad](http://www.nch.com.au/wavepad/)

Wavepad is a simple audio editor from Australia’s NCH Software. This free desktop software supports the editing and conversion of M4A audio file formats.

To edit a file, import the file into the program. You can then select sections to delete, copy, or cut. You can also add audio effects to all of or part of the audio file. Examples of the effects available on Wavepad include echo, reverberation, and normalization.

You also can convert from and to M4A with this program. The “to and fro” conversion will be especially useful to you if you need to convert your files to an iTunes friendly format.

Keep in mind that this audio editor only is free for non-commercial use. If you want to use this editor for professional or money-earning purposes, upgrade to the paid Master version of the software.

**Platform:** Windows, Mac

![Wavepad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wavepad.jpg)

### 4.[Windows Movie Maker](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-movie-maker-download)

Since its 2011 edition, Windows Movie Maker (WMM) has touted free audio editing features. You can edit a variety of audio file formats, including M4A. When you import a M4A file into Windows Movie Maker, the audio file will appear in the audio/music section of the timeline. From there, you edit the m4a file in the same manner you would edit a video on WMM. You can split, combine, and remove sections of the audio.

There are two downsides of using WMM to edit your M4A files.

One downside is that WMM will always output the audio file as a WMA. That being said, WMA files are compatible with most audio playing formats and can easily be converted into another type of audio file, so there’s no need to fret.

The second downside is that the audio editing feature, just as the program’s video editing capabilities, is limited. Not much can be done to increase the loudness or clarity of an audio file. To increase the clarity or loudness of your M4A file, you will need to utilize another audio editor.

**Platform:** Windows only

![Windows Movie Maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-movie-maker.jpg)

### 5.[DJ Audio Editor](http://www.program4pc.com/dj-audio-editor.html#page=page-1)

DJ Audio Editor is a professional-grade free M4A compatible editing software. Import the MP4 file and enjoy the editing process. As with most of the other audio editors on this list, you can apply filters and effects to parts of or all of your file. What makes this audio editor different is the addition of an audio properties editor. You can edit the metadata of each audio file, adding titles, artists, and other pieces of information. DJ Audio Editor is a free product that has a paid version. However, users who take advantage of the free software have most of the benefits paid users have. DJ Audio, despite its various amounts of features, will take up little space on your desktop. The same software company that offers this editing software also offers several other video and audio programs. These programs are also “freenium,” meaning they are free in their most basic form. Working with M4A files does not doom you to paying hundreds of dollars to get a compatible audio editor. Check out the free editors above and see which one is the best for you.

**Platform:** Windows only

### 5. [ImageGlitcher](https://www.airtightinteractive.com/demos/js/imageglitcher/)

You shouldn’t expect great results from this online glitch generator, as the website is poorly designed and it offers only a few basic glitch adjustment options. The size of the photo you upload to the website has an impact on how it is going to be displayed, which means that photos in large resolutions may be difficult to preview.

![ImageGlitcher ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/airtightinteractive-image-glitcher.jpg)

Furthermore, you can only adjust Glitchiness and Brightness options, while you can also toggle the Scan Line option on and off. You can’t do much else with ImageGlitcher, not even share your creations on social media. Applying the glitch effect to a photo may take a while, and the website might crash in the process. That’s why you shouldn’t use ImageGlitcher unless it is your only option to glitch a photo.

**Pros**

* It is free
* Support images saved in JPEG format

**Cons**

* Website crashes easily
* Only basic glitch effect settings
* Poorly designed and difficult to navigate

![Image Glitch Tool ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jpg-glitch.jpg)

What’s more, Image Glitch Tool enables you to take photos with a webcam and apply glitch effect to them just moments after you captured them. The Amount, Seed, Iterations, and Quality sliders allow you to fine-tune the glitch effect so that it fits the image you are editing. However, creating a text overlay with this online glitch generator is not possible as you can only use it to apply the glitch effect to photos.

**Pros**

* Intuitive and functional design
* Allows users to take photos with a webcam
* Photos are adjusted automatically to the platform’s size requirements
* All photos can be uploaded to Imgur directly from Image Glitch Tool

**Cons**
