![Trending Apps in 2019 for iPhone - Steller Discover·Create·Share Stories](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/steller-app-for-creating-share-stories.jpg)

It has already been five years since Steller was named as one of the best apps on the App Store by Apple, but very little has changed in the meantime.

The free version of Unfold offers only a limited range of options, and you must upgrade to Unfold+ if you want to access all of the themes, fonts, and stickers this app provides. Despite the great user rating, Unfold still lacks video and audio editing tools that would allow its users to manipulate their footage without any restrictions.

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

Skin-thinning and skin smoothing filters enable you to beautify the people in your videos and make them more visually appealing to the online audience. The app’s video editor also contains audio editing options that make creating a video’s soundtrack fun and enjoyable.

Besides offering more than twenty filters, Vue also lets you change a video’s playback speed, merge or split multiple clips and enhance the colors of each clip you edit. The seemingly endless library of royalty-free songs offers you all the resources you are going to need while creating a soundtrack for your video, and you can also control the volume of video’s original sound and audio files you added to a project.

### 10 [1 Second Every Day: Video Diary](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1-second-everyday-video-diary/id587823548)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

![Trending Apps in 2019 for iPhone - Mojo Stories Editor ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mojo-stories-editor.jpg)

### 4\. [Over: Design/Flyers/Story Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/over-design-flyer-story-maker/id535811906)

### 6\. [Steller](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/steller/id785128002)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

![Trending Apps in 2019 for iPhone - Steller Discover·Create·Share Stories](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/steller-app-for-creating-share-stories.jpg)

It has already been five years since Steller was named as one of the best apps on the App Store by Apple, but very little has changed in the meantime. You don’t have to be a professional storyteller in order to create engaging visual stories with this app since you can select a theme you like and let Steller do all the heavy lifting for you. There just ten text styles to choose from and the app doesn’t offer even the basic video editing tools, which limits your options throughout the video editing process. Nonetheless, you can share all video content you edit with Steller directly to your Instagram Stories.

### 7\. [Unfold](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unfold-create-stories/id1247275033)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:** Requires iOS 10.0 or later

Creating Facebook or Instagram Stories that attract the attention of thousands of daily viewers is what Unfold does best. You can apply ten different filters and effects to all videos you record with this app and then choose from over 150 video templates. Unfold also grants you access to advanced text tools that enable you to customize the messages you want to distribute through social media channels. The free version of Unfold offers only a limited range of options, and you must upgrade to Unfold+ if you want to access all of the themes, fonts, and stickers this app provides. Despite the great user rating, Unfold still lacks video and audio editing tools that would allow its users to manipulate their footage without any restrictions.

### 8\. [24 FPS – Video Filter & LUT](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/24fps-video-filter-lut/id1341136787)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:** Requires iOS 12.0 or later

In addition to excellent video recording capabilities, this app features a plethora of options you can use to enhance the colors in the videos you edit. Importing LUTs into 24 FPS is a routine operation that can reduce the amount of time you have to spend on giving a video a particular cinematic style. Skin-thinning and skin smoothing filters enable you to beautify the people in your videos and make them more visually appealing to the online audience. The app’s video editor also contains audio editing options that make creating a video’s soundtrack fun and enjoyable.

### 9\. [VUE – Video Camera and Editor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vue-video-camera-and-editor/id1458609369)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

Besides offering more than twenty filters, Vue also lets you change a video’s playback speed, merge or split multiple clips and enhance the colors of each clip you edit. The seemingly endless library of royalty-free songs offers you all the resources you are going to need while creating a soundtrack for your video, and you can also control the volume of video’s original sound and audio files you added to a project.

### 10 [1 Second Every Day: Video Diary](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1-second-everyday-video-diary/id587823548)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases
