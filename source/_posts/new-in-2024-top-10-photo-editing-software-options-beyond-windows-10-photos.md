## Why Can’t I change the aspect ratio of my video?

There are scenarios you may encounter while changing the aspect ratio of your videos. You can refer below to the common issues that require a better fix to overcome the irregular reframing activities.

**Problem:** Even after changing the resolution values to 1440 X 1080 using the final cut pro app, the video frame covers the widescreen without modifying the size concerning the assigned values.

Solution 1: In this situation, you must fix the default spatial fit settings to fill the format in the final cut pro app. When you import the videos for editing, automatically the video would have taken this fit option. Before working on the aspect ratio values, modify the fit to fill settings so that you can crop the unwanted areas in the video frames precisely.

Solution 2: Another alternate solution to overcome the above problem is that you must disclose the Video inspector in your Final Cut Pro application. Then, in the ‘Anamorphic Override’ settings change the value to Standard instead of the none or widescreen mode. By altering this value, you can get the desired outcomes without any hesitation.

## Calculate, Find, and Adjust Image Ratio

You might have noticed that earlier DVDs came with full screen or widescreen viewing choices. Moreover, when you choose the wrong option, it cuts off the movie parts, or the video gets surrounded by black padding.

The standard resolution of your screen stretched from a 4:3 aspect ratio to the wider one. So, producers started making movies that fit on both screens. After the standardization of aspect ratio display, broadcasters pay attention to the image ratio of clips.

So, below is the guide to find, calculate and adjust image ratio with a picture ratio calculator. Let's get started.

#### In this article

01 [What is the image ratio?](#Part 1)

02 [Where Can I Find the Image ratio?](#Part 2)

03 [How to adjust image ratio](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is the image ratio?

The image or aspect ratio is the ratio of width to the height of a picture without any pixels attached. It is expressed with two a colon that separates two numbers, for example, 16:9.

In cinematography, common image ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1, and in TV photography, it is 4:3 and 16:9\. However, in still photography, the standard aspect ratio is 3:2.

## Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?

To select the right photo print size, you must consider the photo ratio and the print ratio. You can not accidentally choose the balance that needs cropping from the sides of the photo.

So, first, you must know how or where you can find the image ratio. The following are the methods to do so:

### Method 1: Check your Camera

The image ratio depends directly on the camera's sensor. You can find the correct balance for photo print based on your camera type. For example, APS-C and Full-frame cameras shoot in a 3:2 ratio. But compact cameras often shoot in a 4:3 ratio.

The photos that you click with your smartphones have a 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. The picture below shows some common photo ratios by type of camera and where it will look great in the home.

![ Common image Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-1.jpg)

### Method 2: Find Image Information

Unlike the photo ratios, image information determines the original width and height of the image in pixels. You can measure the picture dimensions in any unit, but you will always see the web or digital images in pixels.

Always remember that two different pictures with the same image ratio may not have the same dimensions. For example, a picture with size 1920X1080 pixels and a photo with size 1280x720 pixels can both have a 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Method 3: Check with Photoshop

You can quickly check the image ratio in Photoshop (picture ratio calculator) using a crop tool. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:

**●** Open the image in Photoshop.

**●** Choose a crop tool.

**●** Select the photo ratio.

**●** Test different image ratios. You can begin with the standard ratios like 3:2, 16:9, 4:3, or 5:4.

**●** If the crop frame captures the whole picture, it means you have already found the correct ratio.

Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.

Or crop a picture to 2:1\. 3:1\. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.

![Photoshop testing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-2.jpg)

### Method 4: Image Ratio Calculation

You can find the image ratio using the resolution of a photo easily on a window's system. To do so, right-click on an image file and scroll down to the Properties. Under details, you will notice, size of a photo in pixels.

To calculate the photo ratio, divide the width by the height of an image. If the total is an integer, multiply it by other numbers. These numbers are photo ratios.

**Example 1:**

**●** Photo is 4966px by 3312px

**●** Divide 4966 by 3312= 1.5

**●** Now, multiply 1.5 with 2 to obtain a whole number (1.5 X 2= 3)

**●** The photo's ratio is 3:2

**Example 2:**

**●** Photo is 4416 x 3312 px

**●** Divide 4416 by 3312= 1.3

**●** Multiply 1.3 with 3 to obtain a whole number(1.3 x 3= 3.9 or approx. 4)

**●** The photo's ratio is 4:3

## Part 3 How to adjust image ratio

Image ratio is significant in the videography business. But adjusting the video aspect ratio is more critical. Therefore, if you are a video editor, you must know how to do it. There are plenty of options to adjust the aspect ratio, and one of them is to use a photo aspect ratio calculator.

If you want to make permanent adjustments, use a convertor or editor. "Wondershare Filmora" is the best video editor that allows you to create videos with different aspect ratios and adjust these ratios easily.

Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.

Or crop a picture to 2:1\. 3:1\. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.

Clicking on the Convert button will start the file conversion process, and once the WebM file is processed, you should download the MP3 file to your computer.

Besides video files, you can also convert fonts, images or eBooks with Convertio. In order to turn a WebM video into an MP3 file you just have to upload it either from cloud storage or a local hard drive. Optionally, you can click on the Settings icon if you want to customize the bitrate, frequency or volume values. In addition, Convertio enables you to convert only a segment of a WebM video, as you can choose how much of that video you want to cut, by inserting the time in the video where the conversion should start and end.

After you add a WebM video to Zamzar, you just have to set the output format to MP3 and click on the Convert button. Uploading a video file larger than 150MB to the free version of Zamzar is not possible and you must purchase one of the subscription models if you would like to convert WebM videos that have up to 2GB.

Anyone can convert a WebM video to MP3 with File-Converter-Online because the file conversion process is remarkably easy. All you need to do is choose a file from your hard drive you would like to convert, select MP3 as the output file type and click on the Start Converting button. The download process will start automatically, once the WebM file is converted to MP3, although you won’t be able to store your freshly generated audio file on the cloud directly from this platform.

This is a simple but efficient file conversion tool that enables you to convert multiple WebM videos at the same time. However, if you are using the free version of the platform you won’t be able to convert more than two WebM files to MP3 simultaneously. Furthermore, the maximum size of a video file you can convert with this platform is limited to just 500MB regardless of the subscription plan you have. Opting for any of the available subscription plans will grant you access to unlimited conversion hours so that you can convert as many WebM videos as you want each day.

### 10\. [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) \- The Best WebM to MP3 Converter for macOS and Windows 10

![Convert WebM video to MP3 with VLC](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/convert-video-format-with-vlc.jpg)

The simplest and by far the fastest way to convert a WebM video to an MP3 file on PC and Mac computers is to use the VLC media player. After you installed and launched VLC you should click on the Media menu and select the Convert/Save option.

The Open Media window will pop up on the screen, and you just have to click on the Add button located in the File Selection section of the screen in order to import a WebM video into VLC. Afterward, you should click on the Convert/Save button to gain access to the Convert window. Change the Profile setting to Audio – MP3 and click on the Browse button in the Destination section of the window if you want to choose the location on your hard drive where the converted file is going to be saved. After you click on the Start button, VLC will convert you WebM video to MP3 and place the converted file to the folder you specified.

**Conclusion**

Each video saved in WebM file format can be easily converted into an MP3 audio file you can add to your music library. Online WebM to MP3 converters often have size limits, even if you purchase a subscription. That is why it is much easier and less expensive to install VLC media player on your Mac or PC computer if you want to convert WebM videos to MP3 files frequently. What is your favorite WebM to MP3 converter? Let us know in the comments.
