## Top 7 web-based vertical video editors

Even though going through [the aspect ratios](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) a video editing platform supports is important, especially if you want to edit vertically oriented videos, this shouldn’t be the only aspect you consider while choosing a web-based video editor.

The affordability and the available video editing tools can also play an important role in your decision as they determine how efficiently you can edit a vertically oriented video. Let’s take a look at some of the top six web-based vertical video editors.

### 2. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/)
