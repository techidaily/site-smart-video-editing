However, because Shotcut was created for Linux, many users may find the UI a little strange. Regardless, it's still a fantastic editor.

Fastreel allows you to create a video with subs and change the text settings: font, size, color, style, and position. A free membership will allow you to produce and share videos in the format of your choice, as well as access stock media. The cost of a paid subscription is $5.95 per video.

Furthermore, there are several colorful templates for various events — explainer videos, wedding films, YouTube intros, customer testimonials, and so forth. To personalize each template, you may use your own photos, films, music, and text. Plus, every template has its own title and transition style. Fastreel is not made for professional users; it’s a tool for novices and those searching for fast answers.

To use Fastreel subtitle creator online, follow these steps:

* Go to <https://www.fastreel.com/add-subtitles-to-video.html> and click on “Add subtitles now”
* Click the Add Your File button to upload any MOV, MKV, AVI, WMV, or MP4 content less than 500 MB in size. You can add subtitles only to the first hour of a film; therefore, it’s best to pick one with fewer subtitles.
* To add an SRT file to a video, select Upload SRT. You can modify each caption and its timing.
* You can also alter the text’s font, size, color, style, and position. The button labeled “Download SRT” allows you to save the subtitles file for later use.
* Then, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click Continue.
* After finishing, click the Export button. Choose a name and destination for your video, then choose a format. You’ll see the export window where you can select a save option that is appropriate for you. Subtitles will be permanently added to the video.
