## How to edit audio on FCP

There are 2 ways of editing audio of videos on FCP-clip-level audio editing and advanced audio editing.

#### Section 1 Clip-level audio editing

While dragging the audio or video clip onto the timeline you have surely seen the level line right above the clip waveform. One can just drag the level line and move it up or down for adjusting the dB of any given clip.

![ Clip-level audio editing ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-1.png)

The job of the tiny white points on the right and left side of the clip is to apply the fade in and fade out effect on the audio. The left sided point can be dragged to the right to mark the ending of the fade-in effect of the clip. The right point has to be dragged left to set the start of the fade-out point.

**Related Article:** [How to fade in/out audio in Final Cut Pro >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Note:** In this level, any effects and adjustments in audio are applicable for the entire clip including the audio channels within it. All the adjustments in the individual audio channels made by you would be preserved by FCP. This implies that when one reduces the volume for just one channel but increases the volume of the entire clip, then the single channel’s volume is only raised in proportion to the volume of the other channels. Ideally, you should do your edits at the clip-level when you have only one or two audio channels on your video clip.

#### Section 2: Advanced Audio Editing

The audio of the video can be detached for editing the audio file separately. The Audio Inspector of FCP provides you with all precise controls of audio edit like pan, effect, volume, equalization and audio configuration.

![ The Audio Inspector ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-3.png)

In order to detach the audio, you need to go to **Clip** \> **Detach Audio**. Or you can just right-click on the video file and click on Detach audio.

![ Detach audio ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-4.png)

**Note:** There is a fine difference between ‘Detach Audio’ and ‘Expand Audio’. In Expand Audio, the audio clip is synced with the video. For instance, while moving the audio to the timeline, the video clip would also go with it. In case of detaching audio however the audio file would remain as a standalone clip that can be inserted into any portion of the video.

The Audio Inspector would allow you to apply the following effects:

* The volume can be increased by dragging the handle on the right side and lowered by dragging it towards the left.
* Audio Equalization would allow the user to apply various effects (bass, loudness, boost, etc.) on the audio clip. It can also be adjusted by using the in-built audio equalizer.

![ Audio Equalization ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-5.png)

* Pan- Users can select from a number of Pan modes like surround sound or stereo. When you select ‘surround’, Final Cut Pro would provide you with a **Surround Panner** which would allow you to fine-tune the effects by moving the white point.

![Pan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-6.png)

* Effects- for this option one needs to go to the effects browser of the **Audio Inspector** or just hit comd5\. This would allow you to choose many different audio effects such as echo, distortion, spaces and much more. Just double-click on any effect to find a range of editing options.

![Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-7.png)

* Audio Configuration: The audio configuration tool would allow the user to modify the audio channel with mono, stereo, or reverse stereo.

## Cross-Platform Video Editing Mastery: Using Chromebook with Windows and Mac Apps

# How to Run Windows and Mac OS Video Editing Apps on Your Chromebook

Generally, for the same price, you will be able to get a better build quality, longger battery life and lighter Chromebook, compared to Mac and PC. However, it is a common knowledge that Chromebooks don't support Windows or Mac video applications or any other apps that aren't designed for the Chrome OS. But, if you are looking for a way to edit your videos from a Chromebook do not despair because there is a way to use Windows or Mac software. Instead of being forced to use online editors that often provide just a few basic editing options Chromebook users can access editing software that is compatible with Mac or Windows OS. There is more than just one way to gain access to Mac and Windows programs, although before getting your hopes up, you should first check if the Chromebook model you have allows you to install the necessary software.

These solutions may not be obvious, but using them may enable you to use professional editing software that is available for Mac and Windows operating systems. Let's see how you can run Filmora, Final Cut Pro, Sony Vegas Pro or any other powerful video editing software from your Chromebook.

## Part 1: How to Run Windows and Mac OS Video Editing Apps on Chromebook

As we already mentioned there are two different ways to run Mac and Windows OS video editing apps from your Chromebook, although one method is much less complicated than the other. Let's have a look at the methods that will enable you to gain access to all applications you need to create stunning videos.

#### Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote

A simple app that is available at the Google Play Store for free will enable you to access a remote computer and use any programs installed on it from your Chromebook. There are many applications similar to Chrome Desktop Remote, but we chose it because it is simple to use, very effective and completely free.

#### 1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote

The first step is to install the Chrome Desktop Remote app on both the computers you want to pair with and your Chromebook. After the application is installed, you will be presented with two options in the app's main screen Remote Assistance and My Computers.

![chromebook-remote-desktop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-remote-desktop.jpg)

Choose the My Computers option, then click on Get Started button and select the Enable Remote Connections feature. Once you've completed these actions, accept to install the Chrome Desktop Remote Host Installer and after the installation is over, run the installer.

#### 2.Choose PIN

In the next step, you will be asked to select the security PIN for the host computer, that must be numeric and that has at least six digits. After you successfully completed this task the part of the process related to the host computer is finished, although you may want to adjust power saving settings so it doesn't go into a standby mode if it is inactive for too long.

![chromebook-pin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-pin.jpg)

#### 3.Make Connection

In order to establish the connection between your PC and your Chromebook, both devices must sign into the same Google account. Go to the Google Play Store, only this time from you Chromebook and click on the Launch app option, the app should already be installed on the Chromebook you are using as a consequence of Google accounts keeping in sync. After you launched the app go to My Computers option and choose the Get Started feature. Select the computer you'd like to connect to and insert the PIN. After you entered the PIN, click on the Connect option and you should be able to see the desktop of your computer in the web browser.

![chromebook-connection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-connection.jpg)

#### 4.Optimize Options

Due to disparities between screen resolutions, pictures you will be able to see on your Chromebook may appear to be a little grainy. If you'd like to have a sharper and clearer image go to Options and disable Shrink to Fit feature. Furthermore, users who'd like to use video editing apps must make sure that all content they would like to edit is either on the Googe Drive because the Chrome Desktop Remote doesn't offer a direct transfer of files as an option.

#### Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine

The second method is best suited for Chromebook owners who are already running a Linux OS on their devices. The Developer Mode can provide a powerful Linux desktop on Chrombook, although it is a slightly complicated process that can be time-consuming. Before install a Virtual Machine software on Chromebook, you should check if your Chromebook is ARM or Intel based, because Virtual Machine software can't run on ARM powered Chromebooks.

* The first step of the process is to install the Linux OS from the Developer Mode on your Chromebook, then switch to the newly installed OS and start the installation of the Virtual Machine software like Virtual Box or Windows Virtual PC.
* The next step is to install the Windows OS inside the Virtual Box or any other Virtual Machine software you decided to use. This will enable you to switch between Chrome OS and Linux OS with a simple keyboard shortcut or use editing software that is compatible with the Windows OS.

![chromebook-virtual-machine](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-virtual-machine.jpg)

* After you've successfully installed the Windows OS within the Virtual Machine software you can install video editing software that will allow you to edit videos from your Chromebook. The Virtual Machine software takes a lot of hard-drive space so that may not leave too much space for the video footage you'd like to edit with your Chromebook. Even the latest Chromebooks offer barely enough processing power required to run more demanding editing software, so using the software like the Virtual Box may limit their performance even more.

Chromebook owners who would like to have access to Mac and Windows video editing apps will benefit more if they choose to install the Chromebook Desktop Remote application because it is easier to use and it has performed much better than all other methods of accessing software designed for Mac, Windows or Linux operating systems.

Bonus: We highly recommend you to use our Filmora X following the instructions above, we optimized the app for it.

Generally, for the same price, you will be able to get a better build quality, longger battery life and lighter Chromebook, compared to Mac and PC. However, it is a common knowledge that Chromebooks don't support Windows or Mac video applications or any other apps that aren't designed for the Chrome OS. But, if you are looking for a way to edit your videos from a Chromebook do not despair because there is a way to use Windows or Mac software. Instead of being forced to use online editors that often provide just a few basic editing options Chromebook users can access editing software that is compatible with Mac or Windows OS. There is more than just one way to gain access to Mac and Windows programs, although before getting your hopes up, you should first check if the Chromebook model you have allows you to install the necessary software.

These solutions may not be obvious, but using them may enable you to use professional editing software that is available for Mac and Windows operating systems. Let's see how you can run Filmora, Final Cut Pro, Sony Vegas Pro or any other powerful video editing software from your Chromebook.

## Part 1: How to Run Windows and Mac OS Video Editing Apps on Chromebook

As we already mentioned there are two different ways to run Mac and Windows OS video editing apps from your Chromebook, although one method is much less complicated than the other. Let's have a look at the methods that will enable you to gain access to all applications you need to create stunning videos.

#### Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote

A simple app that is available at the Google Play Store for free will enable you to access a remote computer and use any programs installed on it from your Chromebook. There are many applications similar to Chrome Desktop Remote, but we chose it because it is simple to use, very effective and completely free.

#### 1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote

The first step is to install the Chrome Desktop Remote app on both the computers you want to pair with and your Chromebook. After the application is installed, you will be presented with two options in the app's main screen Remote Assistance and My Computers.

![chromebook-remote-desktop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-remote-desktop.jpg)

Choose the My Computers option, then click on Get Started button and select the Enable Remote Connections feature. Once you've completed these actions, accept to install the Chrome Desktop Remote Host Installer and after the installation is over, run the installer.

#### 2.Choose PIN

In the next step, you will be asked to select the security PIN for the host computer, that must be numeric and that has at least six digits. After you successfully completed this task the part of the process related to the host computer is finished, although you may want to adjust power saving settings so it doesn't go into a standby mode if it is inactive for too long.

![chromebook-pin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-pin.jpg)

#### 3.Make Connection

In order to establish the connection between your PC and your Chromebook, both devices must sign into the same Google account. Go to the Google Play Store, only this time from you Chromebook and click on the Launch app option, the app should already be installed on the Chromebook you are using as a consequence of Google accounts keeping in sync. After you launched the app go to My Computers option and choose the Get Started feature. Select the computer you'd like to connect to and insert the PIN. After you entered the PIN, click on the Connect option and you should be able to see the desktop of your computer in the web browser.

![chromebook-connection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-connection.jpg)

#### 4.Optimize Options

Due to disparities between screen resolutions, pictures you will be able to see on your Chromebook may appear to be a little grainy. If you'd like to have a sharper and clearer image go to Options and disable Shrink to Fit feature. Furthermore, users who'd like to use video editing apps must make sure that all content they would like to edit is either on the Googe Drive because the Chrome Desktop Remote doesn't offer a direct transfer of files as an option.

#### Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine

The second method is best suited for Chromebook owners who are already running a Linux OS on their devices. The Developer Mode can provide a powerful Linux desktop on Chrombook, although it is a slightly complicated process that can be time-consuming. Before install a Virtual Machine software on Chromebook, you should check if your Chromebook is ARM or Intel based, because Virtual Machine software can't run on ARM powered Chromebooks.

* The first step of the process is to install the Linux OS from the Developer Mode on your Chromebook, then switch to the newly installed OS and start the installation of the Virtual Machine software like Virtual Box or Windows Virtual PC.
* The next step is to install the Windows OS inside the Virtual Box or any other Virtual Machine software you decided to use. This will enable you to switch between Chrome OS and Linux OS with a simple keyboard shortcut or use editing software that is compatible with the Windows OS.

![chromebook-virtual-machine](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-virtual-machine.jpg)

* After you've successfully installed the Windows OS within the Virtual Machine software you can install video editing software that will allow you to edit videos from your Chromebook. The Virtual Machine software takes a lot of hard-drive space so that may not leave too much space for the video footage you'd like to edit with your Chromebook. Even the latest Chromebooks offer barely enough processing power required to run more demanding editing software, so using the software like the Virtual Box may limit their performance even more.

Chromebook owners who would like to have access to Mac and Windows video editing apps will benefit more if they choose to install the Chromebook Desktop Remote application because it is easier to use and it has performed much better than all other methods of accessing software designed for Mac, Windows or Linux operating systems.

Bonus: We highly recommend you to use our Filmora X following the instructions above, we optimized the app for it.

Turning your or your children’s birthday photos into charming videos you can share on social media is easy with Picovico.

#### 5. [Pholody](https://www.pholody.com/editor)

**Price:** Free

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pholody-image-to-video-online.jpg)

The maximum number of photos you can use in a video is limited to just **twenty**, while the maximum duration of each image in the video can’t exceed the **20-second** mark.

Additionally, you also use Movie Maker Online to search for free music you can use in your videos without having to worry about the copyrights. The platform’s interface, however, is far from perfect and it may take you some time to get used to it and figure out how to add text to the photos you’re using in your video or how to choose for how long a photo is going to be displayed on the screen.

#### 9. [Slideshow Photos](https://slideshow.photos/)

**Price:** Free

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slide-show-online-image-to-video-online.jpg)

However, you will have to install the latest version of Adobe’s Flash Player in order to use this platform, so make sure that this software is updated before you start creating a new slideshow with it. If you choose one of the subscription plans, you will be able to enhance each photo you include in your slideshow, before you export it to social media.

#### 11. [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/make/slideshow-maker/)

**Price:** Free, Available through Adobe Creative Cloud Plan for $52.99 per month or as a stand-alone app for $9.99 per month

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/image-to-video-online-adobe-spark.jpg)
