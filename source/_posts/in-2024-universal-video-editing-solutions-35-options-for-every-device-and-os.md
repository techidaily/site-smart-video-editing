You can now specify the exact time you would like the video to start and end instead of using the clicking and dragging method.

![use timing to trim video with kapwing - set time range](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/kapwing-video-trimmer-9.png)

Clicking the numerals will allow you to use the up and down arrow keys and trim the video to start and end where you have specified.

You can also use the seeker to set the time where you would like the video to start and end, and then go to the numerals and click set to the current time.

### Step 9

Once you have finished trimming your video with Video Trimmer Kapwing, click the Export Video button.
