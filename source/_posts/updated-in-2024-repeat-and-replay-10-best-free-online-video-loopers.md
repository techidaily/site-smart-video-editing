### 02**How to Download Instagram Reels Audio Only?**

This one is a little more complicated — if you don't know how to find the direct URL link for Instagram Reels, but the process is actually much of the same, as we'll show you in the breakdown of the steps below:

**Step 1: Search for Audio**

The first step is to search for the audio that you're looking to download. For this, make sure that you select 'Audio' on the Search options!

![Instagram Search Options - Audio Selected](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-download-instagram-mp3-1.png)

**Step 2: Select Audio!**

Next, select the audio reel that you want to download!

![Instagram Search - Search Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-download-instagram-mp3-2.png)

**Step 3: Share Option!**

Once you've arrived on the audio page of your chosen track, select the share settings at the top right corner of the screen (pointed out in the image below.)

![Instagram Share Audio Option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-download-instagram-mp3-3.png)

**Step 4: Copy Link & Download!**

At the bottom of the screen, you should now find an option to copy the direct URL link of the audio that you've chosen (as shown in the image below!)

Now, as mentioned in the previous section, all you need to do is take that link to an **insta mp3 converter**! The best of which we'll be introducing in the next section.

## Part 2 **The Best 6 Instagram to Mp3 Downloader Online**

Now, for the promised list of **Instagram Video Converter (MP3)** tools! This list will be as comprehensive as we can manage it, including not only an introduction but also the pricing, features, and limitations of all the converters in question.

### 01**INSTAGRAM VIDEO CONVERTER**

**Price**: FREE

The Instagram Video Converter offered on the 'Online Video Converter' website is the first **Insta MP3 converter** on this list! It's incredibly easy to use, and is free to boot! So, you can **convert MP3 Instagram** audio with no problem. Keep in mind, of course, that because this tool is free, it does come with its limits as well as general cons.

| Features                                                                                                                  | Limits                                                                                                                              |

### 02**Ace Thinker**

**Price**: FREE

Our next **Instagram Video Converter (MP3)** is Ace Thinker. Just like the one from 'Online Video Converter' this is an online solution that you can use on any device (be it your smartphone or Windows/Mac computer). It's also 100% free, so you can use it without having to worry about making any long-term commitments.

| Features                                                                       | Limits                                                                                          |

### 03**Instasaved**

**Price**: FREE

With our next pick, we spice it up with an Instagram-specific tool, called Instasave that you can use to download pretty much any kind of Instagram content that you want. That, of course, includes allowing you to **convert MP3 Instagram** posts! Note, however, this is not as well-known as other options out there, so use it mindfully!

| Features                                                                                                                         | Limits                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● Instagram content downloader ● Multiple file format converter ● Online video converter - no download or installation required. | ● Conversion tool only ● No quality control ● Can only be used when online |

![Instasaved - Anonymous Instagram Video Downloaderr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-download-instagram-mp3-7.png)

### 04**OffMP3**

**Price**: Free

Next on our list is OFFMP3\. It is, much like the other tools we've introduced thus far, an online video converter tool! This one, however, just like Intasaved, is a lot more obscure than the first two that we introduced. And thus, a little more limited.

| Features                                                                  | Limits                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● Online video converter ● FREE-to-use ● Multiple video conversion format | ● For online use only ● Obscure site ● Comes with potentially harmful ads |

![OffMP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-download-instagram-mp3-8.png)

### 05**4ins**

**Price**: FREE

Despite the name, 4in's Instagram to MP4 converter does work for converting Instagram posts into MP3 files as well (as is shown in the image below). It's not the most advanced converter tool out there. But it does work, and it requires no download or installation.

| Features                                                                                                                 | Limits                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
