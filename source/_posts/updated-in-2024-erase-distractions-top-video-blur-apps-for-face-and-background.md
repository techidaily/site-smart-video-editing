## How to Choose an Alternative to Adobe Premiere Pro for Linux?

Out of these 10 software discussed above, which software you want to use is still a bit confusing. If you need basic editing software that is free and open source, you should go for Kdenlive

DaVinci Resolve provides advanced editing features such as color correction, and multi-track editing. This can be your choice if you have a good budget.

Lightworks and Flowblade are the best options if you have got a low budget and need advanced editing options. They provide a good value for money experience.

Open Movie Editor, Cinelerra, Avidemux, OpenShot, and Pitivi are free and easy-to-use software that are the best options for beginners.

Besides, if you are going to switch from Linux to Windows or MacOS. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can be your good choice to go. It owns built-in stock media and features that are not so complicated as compared to other software.

## Final Words

It has been discussed in detail that there are many free as well as paid editing software that can be used for Linux. Adobe premiere pro is not available for Linux, so one must go with any of these above-mentioned editing products. Free versions are for beginners as they contain basic editing features but paid versions can fulfill the demands of professional moviemakers too.

You can download and install any software according to your demands very easily as they are available on the app store. In the absence of adobe premiere pro, these products add such effects and transitions to your videos/films that make them amazing and thrilling to watch.
