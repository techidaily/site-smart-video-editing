A story ides is priceless. It is always important to build an essential story frame. Sometimes it is in a blink to have come up with an idea.

It will help if you **decide the gist** of your 2D animation because the whole process of making animation is evolving. You may need to add or cut some scenes, but the overall concept and story ideas are always the same.

![Put forward an idea](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-01.gif)

 **Step 2  Make a storyboard**

After all the ideas are fixed, you need to [make a storyboard for animation](https://www.bloopanimation.com/how-to-storyboard/). You don't need to produce every scene, but it is suggested to make a storyboard in some crucial scenes. Storyboarding is probably the best way to show 2D animation to other people and get feedback.

 **Step 4  Animation**

After all, materials are ready, and you need to make animation alive. In this step, you need to make sure all the movements are natural. Stiff moves are not liked by the audience, so you need to think about how to design gestures, movements, and facial expressions.
