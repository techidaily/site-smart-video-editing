## 04 [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) \- Need Some Time to Learn This Animation Tool

**Pro**: Really powerful software that you can make for professional users.

## 05 [K-3D](http://www.k-3d.org/) \- Best for Animation and Modeling in 3D

**Difficulty Level**: Middle

**Pro**: Ideal for designing simple 3D animations and models.

**Con**: It has an old-fashioned interface. Also, the built-render (RenderMan) feature is difficult to use by beginners.

K-3D is an animation and 3D modeling software. You can download this tool for free on your Mac. Besides, you can also install and run it on your Windows and Linux systems. If you look at the design, you will find that the software is quite old. But don’t judge a book by its cover. Why so? It is because K-3D is one of the strongest and most versatile tools for 3D artists with many options.

For example, K-3D offers extremely systematic and methodological workflows. You can easily adjust the properties of the features in real-time and get instant results. It has a node-oriented visualization pipeline to enjoy more freedom. That means you can create animation using a variety of combinations.

One of the best things about K-3D is that it has three subdivisions of animation. You can work on your model on one side while showing the other side in a mirrored form. Then, experience the final result combined together. And in case you need to make the changes to the end results, you can simply work on the first subdivision and savor automatic changes to the results.

K-3D has an advanced redo and undo mechanism to ensure you can go back or move forward to make corrections or amendments without limits. Additionally, the tool is developed keeping in mind all the industrial standards. For instance, it has complete support and integration of native RenderMan™ to its user interface. This is an excellent feature because most free animation software for Mac requires third-party render plugins.

**Features:**

* Parametric workflow.
* 2D and 3D animation tools.
* Allows Python and K3DScript scripting.

![K-3D](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/K-3D.png)

## 06 [Krita](https://krita.org/en/download/krita-desktop/) \- For Professional 2D Animators

**Difficulty Level**: Middle

**Pro**: Ideal for designing simple 3D animations and models.

K-3D is an animation and 3D modeling software. You can download this tool for free on your Mac. Besides, you can also install and run it on your Windows and Linux systems. If you look at the design, you will find that the software is quite old. But don’t judge a book by its cover. Why so? It is because K-3D is one of the strongest and most versatile tools for 3D artists with many options.

For example, K-3D offers extremely systematic and methodological workflows. You can easily adjust the properties of the features in real-time and get instant results. It has a node-oriented visualization pipeline to enjoy more freedom. That means you can create animation using a variety of combinations.

One of the best things about K-3D is that it has three subdivisions of animation. You can work on your model on one side while showing the other side in a mirrored form. Then, experience the final result combined together. And in case you need to make the changes to the end results, you can simply work on the first subdivision and savor automatic changes to the results.

K-3D has an advanced redo and undo mechanism to ensure you can go back or move forward to make corrections or amendments without limits. Additionally, the tool is developed keeping in mind all the industrial standards. For instance, it has complete support and integration of native RenderMan™ to its user interface. This is an excellent feature because most free animation software for Mac requires third-party render plugins.

* Parametric workflow.

If you look at the design, you will find that the software is quite old. But don’t judge a book by its cover. Why so?

For example, K-3D offers extremely systematic and methodological workflows. You can easily adjust the properties of the features in real-time and get instant results. It has a node-oriented visualization pipeline to enjoy more freedom. That means you can create animation using a variety of combinations.

One of the best things about K-3D is that it has three subdivisions of animation. You can work on your model on one side while showing the other side in a mirrored form. Then, experience the final result combined together. And in case you need to make the changes to the end results, you can simply work on the first subdivision and savor automatic changes to the results.

K-3D has an advanced redo and undo mechanism to ensure you can go back or move forward to make corrections or amendments without limits. Additionally, the tool is developed keeping in mind all the industrial standards. For instance, it has complete support and integration of native RenderMan™ to its user interface. This is an excellent feature because most free animation software for Mac requires third-party render plugins.

**Features:**

* Parametric workflow.

**Difficulty Level**: Difficult

**Pro**: Really powerful software that you can make for professional users.

**Con**: It is not easy to make image animation as it focuses on 3D.

**Difficulty Level**: Middle

**Pro**: Ideal for designing simple 3D animations and models.

**Con**: It has an old-fashioned interface. Also, the built-render (RenderMan) feature is difficult to use by beginners.

K-3D is an animation and 3D modeling software. You can download this tool for free on your Mac. Besides, you can also install and run it on your Windows and Linux systems. If you look at the design, you will find that the software is quite old. But don’t judge a book by its cover. Why so? It is because K-3D is one of the strongest and most versatile tools for 3D artists with many options.

For example, K-3D offers extremely systematic and methodological workflows. You can easily adjust the properties of the features in real-time and get instant results. It has a node-oriented visualization pipeline to enjoy more freedom. That means you can create animation using a variety of combinations.

One of the best things about K-3D is that it has three subdivisions of animation. You can work on your model on one side while showing the other side in a mirrored form. Then, experience the final result combined together. And in case you need to make the changes to the end results, you can simply work on the first subdivision and savor automatic changes to the results.

K-3D has an advanced redo and undo mechanism to ensure you can go back or move forward to make corrections or amendments without limits. Additionally, the tool is developed keeping in mind all the industrial standards. For instance, it has complete support and integration of native RenderMan™ to its user interface. This is an excellent feature because most free animation software for Mac requires third-party render plugins.

**Features:**

* Parametric workflow.
* 2D and 3D animation tools.

At the same time, you can also add text to your animation by using the text tool.

**Step 1:** Go to the website, click the “Select file…” button, and choose the video you want that’s troubling you with its shakiness. Keep in mind that you can only upload MP4 files (500MB maximum).

So, if you have a video in other video formats, you will need to convert it into MP4 first.

**Step 2:**  After selecting the video, click the “Upload Video File” button to start the process.

**Step 3:**  Once this tool corrects the shaky video, save it on your computer.

Stabilizo is another pick to stabilize shaky videos online for free. While the software also offers other services like a PDF converter and video compressor, the tool is famous for stabilizing videos recorded on different devices.

Usually, it takes a few minutes to work on the video, but it depends on the size of your footage and internet speed. If the video is recorded at a high resolution or you have slow internet, Stabilizo might take more than 5 minutes to do the job.

This is how the tool works:

**Step 1:** Go to the website and click the “Browse” button to select the video you want to stabilize.

**Step 2:** Click the “Upload Video” button to upload the video (500MB max) on the tool and wait until the software stabilizes the video.

**Step 3:** Once it’s completed, click the “Download File” button to save the video on your computer.

VideoUtils is a complete pack of great tools for online video editing. You can rely on this free web-based program for audio, image, video, and even PDF editing. Nevertheless, you can simply check the “Video Stabilizer” tool to correct the shakiness you’ve got in your video during recording.

It has a simple interface and is also a bit familiar with previous video stabilizing tools mentioned in this list. But unlike most, this online stabilizer supports various video formats, such as AVI, MOV, MP4, WEBM, and MKV.
