Video resolution is a way to determine how realistic or clear your video appears. You can measure it with the number of pixels in a standard aspect ratio (16:9).

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios for TV or computer screens. Also, a higher number of video aspect ratio pixels means high resolution.

The 720 or 1080 resolutions have naming conventions usually based on the pixels running in the vertical line of the display area. Whereas resolutions like 2K, 4K, or 8K have naming conventions based on pixels numbers in the horizontal lines across digital frames.

The growth of video sharing on social media has ensured the adoption of HD definition screens. So, let us know more about its concepts.

## Part 1 What is HD Video?

High-definition video (HDV) is a third-generation technology for videos. Its video resolution, file size, and screen size are more significant than a standard video or other video forms. It provides more flexibility, including technical variables of videos.

![HDV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-1.jpg)

Generally, it is a video with 1280×720 (720p) or 1920×1080 (1080p) resolutions. It's all formats are widescreen and display 24 to 60 frames in a second.

## Part 2 What is the Pixel Size of HD Video?

HD Video is the lowest video resolution accepted for the web content of smaller size. However, most screens are available in HD nowadays. So, it would be best to use a resolution higher than 720 p for streaming or web.

Pixel Size of HD video is 1280 x 720.

## Part 3 Video resolution and corresponding file sizes

Video resolutions are the standards set by video manufacturers or broadcasting companies. Video resolution is similar to a haircut. You can always decrease a high-resolution video to a lower one but can never increase the low resolution.

So, decide the video resolutions keeping storage space and other aspects in mind. Here are different formats that can help you to make a wise decision:

### 1\. Standard Definition

Standard Definition does not have many pixels; as a result, it has low resolution. Two common SD resolutions are 640× 480 and 640×360\. These resolutions are the best for small mobiles.

It is an excellent option to consider if you have a slow internet connection.

### 2\. 720 Resolution (HD)

It is the lowest video resolution and is often called HD. Usually, you shoot most videos at 1080p, but 720p can still be acceptable to create smaller web content. However, it would be best to aim for a resolution higher than 720p.

### 3\. 1080 Resolution (Full HD)

1080 (1920 \* 1080 pixels), often known as Full HD, is the industry standard for making a digital video. It does not need much storage space and is a typical screen resolution for digital phones.

### 4\. 2K Resolution or QHD (Quad High Definition)

2K resolution (2048 x 1080 pixels)or QHD (2560 x 1440 pixels) formats provide room for photo edits. In addition, they offer larger displays or reframing files without their lost quality.

### 5\. 4K Resolution (Ultra HD)

Ultra HD, often known as 4K resolution, is 3840 x 2160 pixels technically. It looks similar to 2K to the viewers but gives videomakers some room to zoom in or edit.

![File Size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-2.jpg)

## Part 4 Are 480P, 720P, 960P Considered HD?

* 720p is also popular with the name HD (high-definition). It is a display resolution that measures 1280 x 720 pixels.
* 480p often known as Standard Definition (SD). It usually starts at 240 p and ends at 480 p. So, 480 p is a semi-HD.
* 960 X 480 p is a progressive camera scan format usually used in surveillance cameras, webcams, or action POV cams. It adds a wide horizontal view as compared to the standard definition. But it is less than HD.

## Part 5 Is HD 2K or 1K?

1K means there are 1000 pixels. So 1080p, as in the vertical portion of a screen, is 1K. In contrast, a typical 1080p resolution with the horizontal part is 1920, or 2K.

Although 1080p has the exact vertical resolution like DCI 2K resolutions (1080 pixels), it has a smaller horizontal resolution. As a result, it is below the range of 2K resolution formats.

1080p is almost equivalent to 2K. It is because "p" and "i" measure the height of an image in pixels, while "K" measures the width of an image in thousands of pixels.

So with a size of 1080 pixels, the corresponding width of 1920 pixels uses a 16:9 aspect ratio.

Video resolution is a way to determine how realistic or clear your video appears. You can measure it with the number of pixels in a standard aspect ratio (16:9).

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios for TV or computer screens. Also, a higher number of video aspect ratio pixels means high resolution.

The 720 or 1080 resolutions have naming conventions usually based on the pixels running in the vertical line of the display area. Whereas resolutions like 2K, 4K, or 8K have naming conventions based on pixels numbers in the horizontal lines across digital frames.

The growth of video sharing on social media has ensured the adoption of HD definition screens. So, let us know more about its concepts.

## Part 1 What is HD Video?

High-definition video (HDV) is a third-generation technology for videos. Its video resolution, file size, and screen size are more significant than a standard video or other video forms. It provides more flexibility, including technical variables of videos.

![HDV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-1.jpg)

Generally, it is a video with 1280×720 (720p) or 1920×1080 (1080p) resolutions. It's all formats are widescreen and display 24 to 60 frames in a second.

## Part 2 What is the Pixel Size of HD Video?

HD Video is the lowest video resolution accepted for the web content of smaller size. However, most screens are available in HD nowadays. So, it would be best to use a resolution higher than 720 p for streaming or web.

Pixel Size of HD video is 1280 x 720.

## Part 3 Video resolution and corresponding file sizes

Video resolutions are the standards set by video manufacturers or broadcasting companies. Video resolution is similar to a haircut. You can always decrease a high-resolution video to a lower one but can never increase the low resolution.

So, decide the video resolutions keeping storage space and other aspects in mind. Here are different formats that can help you to make a wise decision:

### 1\. Standard Definition

Standard Definition does not have many pixels; as a result, it has low resolution. Two common SD resolutions are 640× 480 and 640×360\. These resolutions are the best for small mobiles.

It is an excellent option to consider if you have a slow internet connection.

### 2\. 720 Resolution (HD)

It is the lowest video resolution and is often called HD. Usually, you shoot most videos at 1080p, but 720p can still be acceptable to create smaller web content. However, it would be best to aim for a resolution higher than 720p.

### 3\. 1080 Resolution (Full HD)

1080 (1920 \* 1080 pixels), often known as Full HD, is the industry standard for making a digital video. It does not need much storage space and is a typical screen resolution for digital phones.

### 4\. 2K Resolution or QHD (Quad High Definition)

2K resolution (2048 x 1080 pixels)or QHD (2560 x 1440 pixels) formats provide room for photo edits. In addition, they offer larger displays or reframing files without their lost quality.

### 5\. 4K Resolution (Ultra HD)

Ultra HD, often known as 4K resolution, is 3840 x 2160 pixels technically. It looks similar to 2K to the viewers but gives videomakers some room to zoom in or edit.

![File Size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-2.jpg)

## Part 4 Are 480P, 720P, 960P Considered HD?

* 720p is also popular with the name HD (high-definition). It is a display resolution that measures 1280 x 720 pixels.
* 480p often known as Standard Definition (SD). It usually starts at 240 p and ends at 480 p. So, 480 p is a semi-HD.
* 960 X 480 p is a progressive camera scan format usually used in surveillance cameras, webcams, or action POV cams. It adds a wide horizontal view as compared to the standard definition. But it is less than HD.

## Part 5 Is HD 2K or 1K?

1K means there are 1000 pixels. So 1080p, as in the vertical portion of a screen, is 1K. In contrast, a typical 1080p resolution with the horizontal part is 1920, or 2K.

Although 1080p has the exact vertical resolution like DCI 2K resolutions (1080 pixels), it has a smaller horizontal resolution. As a result, it is below the range of 2K resolution formats.

1080p is almost equivalent to 2K. It is because "p" and "i" measure the height of an image in pixels, while "K" measures the width of an image in thousands of pixels.

So with a size of 1080 pixels, the corresponding width of 1920 pixels uses a 16:9 aspect ratio.

Final Cut Pro was customized for video editing professionals with advanced knowledge of video editing. It is available for just $299.99 with 90 days free trial.

## Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?

Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.

Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.

It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.

## Part 2: Is Final Cut Express Still Available?

No, concurrent with the launch of Final Cut Pro X on June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued and removed from the Apple online store.

You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.

Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.

Boring and unexciting videos may turn off your mode. You need something special or wonderful that could turn you on and make your memories worth watching.

To let users give a new look to their pictures and videos, Apple Inc. released its first video editing software Final Cut Express in 2003\. Over the next few years, various improvements were made in its updated versions.

![Final-Cut-Express](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Final-Cut-Express.png)

However, after multiple inconveniences, Apple Inc. discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 and launched its new version Final Cut Pro with advanced video editing features. Final Cut Pro was customized for video editing professionals with advanced knowledge of video editing. It is available for just $299.99 with 90 days free trial.

Some alternatives to Final Cut Express are also available in the market such as Final Cut Pro of crouse, iMovie, a low-end alternative, and Filmora, popular among beginners and pros. Let’s look at these tools individually in this article.

## Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?

Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.

Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.

It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.

## Part 2: Is Final Cut Express Still Available?

No, concurrent with the launch of Final Cut Pro X on June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued and removed from the Apple online store.

You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.

Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.

As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!

Boring and unexciting videos may turn off your mode. You need something special or wonderful that could turn you on and make your memories worth watching.

To let users give a new look to their pictures and videos, Apple Inc. released its first video editing software Final Cut Express in 2003\. Over the next few years, various improvements were made in its updated versions.

![Final-Cut-Express](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Final-Cut-Express.png)

However, after multiple inconveniences, Apple Inc. discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 and launched its new version Final Cut Pro with advanced video editing features. Final Cut Pro was customized for video editing professionals with advanced knowledge of video editing. It is available for just $299.99 with 90 days free trial.

Some alternatives to Final Cut Express are also available in the market such as Final Cut Pro of crouse, iMovie, a low-end alternative, and Filmora, popular among beginners and pros. Let’s look at these tools individually in this article.

## Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?

Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.

Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.

It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.

## Part 2: Is Final Cut Express Still Available?

No, concurrent with the launch of Final Cut Pro X on June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued and removed from the Apple online store.

You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.

Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.

As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!

Boring and unexciting videos may turn off your mode. You need something special or wonderful that could turn you on and make your memories worth watching.

To let users give a new look to their pictures and videos, Apple Inc. released its first video editing software Final Cut Express in 2003\. Over the next few years, various improvements were made in its updated versions.

![Final-Cut-Express](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Final-Cut-Express.png)

However, after multiple inconveniences, Apple Inc. discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 and launched its new version Final Cut Pro with advanced video editing features. Final Cut Pro was customized for video editing professionals with advanced knowledge of video editing. It is available for just $299.99 with 90 days free trial.

Some alternatives to Final Cut Express are also available in the market such as Final Cut Pro of crouse, iMovie, a low-end alternative, and Filmora, popular among beginners and pros. Let’s look at these tools individually in this article.

## Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?

Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.

Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.

It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.

## Part 2: Is Final Cut Express Still Available?

No, concurrent with the launch of Final Cut Pro X on June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued and removed from the Apple online store.

You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.

Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.

As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!

## **Part 5: Best Alternative to Final Cut Express**

Now, as Final Cut Express is no longer available, you may want to try the other two editors of Apple. While iMovie mainly targeted beginners, Final Cut Express and Pro targeted users with moderate to advanced knowledge of video editing.

For those beginners who wanted to make professional-looking videos without any editing skills, Wondershare launched Filmora as an alternative to Final Cut Express and Pro.

This user-friendly made video editing as simple as ABC. From offering multiple hand-picked effects to advanced editing options, Filmora allows you to range markers, perfect your audio, group timeline clips, and perform detailed color correction with auto-correction and color wheels for free.

So does Filmora helps cut and trim AVI videos? Yes! It does if you follow these steps correctly.

**Step 1: Download Filmora Video Editor**

First, [download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) Filmora Video Editor by choosing your operating system, as seen in the screenshot below.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-1.jpg)

Run the setup and let it finish without any pause or break.

**Step 2: Import Your Video to Filmora Video Editor**

Importing your AVI video is a very simple process. Just click on the “Film Clip” icon.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-2.jpg)

It will open a new window screen on your computer to select the video from the directory. Find the clip you want to import and cut. Use your mouse to select it and click the “Open” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-3.jpg)

The video will be loaded in the “Media” folder of Filmora. The clip's thumbnail should be visible to assure you have done everything correctly.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg)

If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline**

Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg)

After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-6.jpg)

You will see the video on the timeline with its preview on the “Preview Screen” on the right side of the interface.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg)

**Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora**

Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”

Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg)

It has an important role in cutting your videos.

So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg)

As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg)

The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.

Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg)

And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg)

If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg)

Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.

**_Note_**_: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts._

Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg)

Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg)

Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.

Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg)

You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.

**Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora**

Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things. Trimming allows you to remove a particular video part from visibility without deleting the portion.

So feel free to skip this step if you’re happy learning the cutting technique. But if you’re interested in trimming, here’s how you do it.

Take your mouse cursor at the beginning or end of the clip you want to trim. Keep holding the clip’s corner and slide the mouse back or front to trim the part

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-19.jpg)

**_Note:_** _Since the trim tool doesn’t delete the video, the final project based on trimming will be of a larger size. Therefore, it is advised to cut videos rather than trimming for fast rendering, better results, and small video size._

**Step 6: Save Project and Export Your Cut/Trimmed AVI Video**

Choose “Save Project” from the “File” menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-20.jpg)

Select the directory to save the project, rename the new video, and click the “Save” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-21.jpg)

Click on the “Export” button to save the video in AVI or any other video format of your choice on your computer.

## Part 2: Top 3 Free AVI Video Cutter on Windows

As a Windows user, finding an excellent video cutter is relatively easy. However, not all software permits importing AVI videos. In the same way, some video trimmers come at a price. So if you really don’t want to pay and enjoy cutting your AVI files, try using these three video cutting tools.

### Microsoft Photos (Windows 10)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-23.jpg)

[Microsoft Photos](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-photos/9WZDNCRFJBH4?hl=en-pk&gl=PK) or Photo App is a free photo viewer and editor with your Windows 10\. It offers incredible photo editing and enhancement along with different tools for organizing and editing videos in a very friendly way. Likewise, you can create drawings over the videos and add 3D effects and background music to your clips.

You can also trim AVI videos with Microsoft Photos quickly. All you need to do is open your clip with the Photo App, choose the “Trim” option, select a portion of the video you want to trim, and go ahead.

That’s it!

**Features**

* Quick video trimming
* Cool text effects
* 3D library and effects
* It has a clear interface
* You can find and tag people’s faces
* The program has 15+ filters for editing
* Motion tracking option for drawing on videos
* Allows you to view and organize your files easily

**Pros**

* Microsoft Photos is free for Windows users
* It automatically creates albums
* The program has a touch-friendly interface
* You can integrate your OneDrive with the software

**Cons**

* Lacks before and after view
* Not included in older Windows versions
* It doesn’t support selective focus or panorama stitching

### Handbrake

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-24.jpg)

[Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/downloads.php) is best-known for its video transcoding traits. Unlike typical video editors, this open-source tool includes limited options to rip Blu-rays and DVDs. Moreover, you can mix the 5.1 soundtracks and convert them to stereo to make the audio compatible with your TV speakers.

But the exciting thing about Handbrake is that you can use this software on your macOS 10.13 or later versions to cut AVI videos for free. However, it’s a bit technical process, as there’s no timeline to help you trim or make cuts on the clips directly with the help of your mouse.

You are required to mention a time range (seconds, minutes, or hours) to keep a specific part of the video while the software removes the non-ranged parts of the clip. For instance, you have a video of 10 seconds. You start the range from 5 seconds and end it at 10 seconds. So, the first four seconds of the video will be cut from the entire clip.

**Features**

* Video cutting, cropping, and resizing
* Low-quality and old video restoration
* Video conversion from any format to MKV or MP4

**Pros**

* Handbrake is free
* You can convert batch videos with ease
* It supports MAC, Windows, and Linux OS
* Allows you to import video files in all major formats
* The software comes with various video conversion presets

**Cons**

* Handbrake is not a user-friendly tool
* The video file output is limited to two formats (MKV and MP4) only

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-1.jpg)

Run the setup and let it finish without any pause or break.

**Step 2: Import Your Video to Filmora Video Editor**

Importing your AVI video is a very simple process. Just click on the “Film Clip” icon.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-2.jpg)

It will open a new window screen on your computer to select the video from the directory. Find the clip you want to import and cut. Use your mouse to select it and click the “Open” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-3.jpg)

The video will be loaded in the “Media” folder of Filmora. The clip's thumbnail should be visible to assure you have done everything correctly.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg)

If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline**

Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg)

After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-6.jpg)

You will see the video on the timeline with its preview on the “Preview Screen” on the right side of the interface.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg)

**Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora**

Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”

Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg)

It has an important role in cutting your videos.

So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg)

As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg)

The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.

Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg)

And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg)

If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg)

Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.

**_Note_**_: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts._

Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg)

Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg)

Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.

Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg)

You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.

**Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora**

Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things. Trimming allows you to remove a particular video part from visibility without deleting the portion.

So feel free to skip this step if you’re happy learning the cutting technique. But if you’re interested in trimming, here’s how you do it.

Take your mouse cursor at the beginning or end of the clip you want to trim. Keep holding the clip’s corner and slide the mouse back or front to trim the part

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-19.jpg)

**_Note:_** _Since the trim tool doesn’t delete the video, the final project based on trimming will be of a larger size. Therefore, it is advised to cut videos rather than trimming for fast rendering, better results, and small video size._

**Step 6: Save Project and Export Your Cut/Trimmed AVI Video**

Choose “Save Project” from the “File” menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-20.jpg)

Select the directory to save the project, rename the new video, and click the “Save” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-21.jpg)

Click on the “Export” button to save the video in AVI or any other video format of your choice on your computer.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-22.jpg)

## Part 2: Top 3 Free AVI Video Cutter on Windows

As a Windows user, finding an excellent video cutter is relatively easy. However, not all software permits importing AVI videos. In the same way, some video trimmers come at a price. So if you really don’t want to pay and enjoy cutting your AVI files, try using these three video cutting tools.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-1.jpg)

Run the setup and let it finish without any pause or break.

**Step 2: Import Your Video to Filmora Video Editor**

Importing your AVI video is a very simple process. Just click on the “Film Clip” icon.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-2.jpg)

It will open a new window screen on your computer to select the video from the directory. Find the clip you want to import and cut. Use your mouse to select it and click the “Open” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-3.jpg)

The video will be loaded in the “Media” folder of Filmora. The clip's thumbnail should be visible to assure you have done everything correctly.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg)

If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline**

Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg)

After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-6.jpg)

You will see the video on the timeline with its preview on the “Preview Screen” on the right side of the interface.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg)

**Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora**

Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”

Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg)

It has an important role in cutting your videos.

So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg)

As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg)

The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.

Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg)

And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg)

If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg)

Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.

**_Note_**_: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts._

Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg)

Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg)

Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.

Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg)

You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.

**Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora**

Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things. Trimming allows you to remove a particular video part from visibility without deleting the portion.

So feel free to skip this step if you’re happy learning the cutting technique. But if you’re interested in trimming, here’s how you do it.

Take your mouse cursor at the beginning or end of the clip you want to trim. Keep holding the clip’s corner and slide the mouse back or front to trim the part

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-19.jpg)

**_Note:_** _Since the trim tool doesn’t delete the video, the final project based on trimming will be of a larger size. Therefore, it is advised to cut videos rather than trimming for fast rendering, better results, and small video size._

**Step 6: Save Project and Export Your Cut/Trimmed AVI Video**

Choose “Save Project” from the “File” menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-20.jpg)

Select the directory to save the project, rename the new video, and click the “Save” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-21.jpg)

Click on the “Export” button to save the video in AVI or any other video format of your choice on your computer.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-22.jpg)

## Part 2: Top 3 Free AVI Video Cutter on Windows

As a Windows user, finding an excellent video cutter is relatively easy. However, not all software permits importing AVI videos. In the same way, some video trimmers come at a price. So if you really don’t want to pay and enjoy cutting your AVI files, try using these three video cutting tools.

But the exciting thing about Handbrake is that you can use this software on your macOS 10.13 or later versions to cut AVI videos for free. However, it’s a bit technical process, as there’s no timeline to help you trim or make cuts on the clips directly with the help of your mouse.

You are required to mention a time range (seconds, minutes, or hours) to keep a specific part of the video while the software removes the non-ranged parts of the clip. For instance, you have a video of 10 seconds. You start the range from 5 seconds and end it at 10 seconds. So, the first four seconds of the video will be cut from the entire clip.

* Low-quality and old video restoration

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-1.jpg)

Run the setup and let it finish without any pause or break.

**Step 2: Import Your Video to Filmora Video Editor**

Importing your AVI video is a very simple process. Just click on the “Film Clip” icon.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-2.jpg)

It will open a new window screen on your computer to select the video from the directory. Find the clip you want to import and cut. Use your mouse to select it and click the “Open” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-3.jpg)

The video will be loaded in the “Media” folder of Filmora. The clip's thumbnail should be visible to assure you have done everything correctly.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg)

If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline**

Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg)

After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-6.jpg)

You will see the video on the timeline with its preview on the “Preview Screen” on the right side of the interface.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg)

**Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora**

Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”

Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg)

It has an important role in cutting your videos.

So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg)

As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg)

The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.

Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg)

And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg)

If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg)

Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.

**_Note_**_: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts._

Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg)

Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg)

Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.

Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg)

You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.

**Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora**

Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things. Trimming allows you to remove a particular video part from visibility without deleting the portion.

So feel free to skip this step if you’re happy learning the cutting technique. But if you’re interested in trimming, here’s how you do it.

Take your mouse cursor at the beginning or end of the clip you want to trim. Keep holding the clip’s corner and slide the mouse back or front to trim the part

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-19.jpg)

**_Note:_** _Since the trim tool doesn’t delete the video, the final project based on trimming will be of a larger size. Therefore, it is advised to cut videos rather than trimming for fast rendering, better results, and small video size._

**Step 6: Save Project and Export Your Cut/Trimmed AVI Video**

Choose “Save Project” from the “File” menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-20.jpg)

Select the directory to save the project, rename the new video, and click the “Save” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-21.jpg)

Click on the “Export” button to save the video in AVI or any other video format of your choice on your computer.

## Part 2: Top 3 Free AVI Video Cutter on Windows

As a Windows user, finding an excellent video cutter is relatively easy. However, not all software permits importing AVI videos. In the same way, some video trimmers come at a price. So if you really don’t want to pay and enjoy cutting your AVI files, try using these three video cutting tools.

### Microsoft Photos (Windows 10)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-23.jpg)

It offers incredible photo editing and enhancement along with different tools for organizing and editing videos in a very friendly way. Likewise, you can create drawings over the videos and add 3D effects and background music to your clips.

You can also trim AVI videos with Microsoft Photos quickly. All you need to do is open your clip with the Photo App, choose the “Trim” option, select a portion of the video you want to trim, and go ahead.

That’s it!

Moreover, you can mix the 5.1 soundtracks and convert them to stereo to make the audio compatible with your TV speakers.

But the exciting thing about Handbrake is that you can use this software on your macOS 10.13 or later versions to cut AVI videos for free. However, it’s a bit technical process, as there’s no timeline to help you trim or make cuts on the clips directly with the help of your mouse.

You are required to mention a time range (seconds, minutes, or hours) to keep a specific part of the video while the software removes the non-ranged parts of the clip. For instance, you have a video of 10 seconds. You start the range from 5 seconds and end it at 10 seconds. So, the first four seconds of the video will be cut from the entire clip.

**Features**

* Video cutting, cropping, and resizing
* Low-quality and old video restoration
* Video conversion from any format to MKV or MP4

**Pros**

* Handbrake is free

**Features**

![mp4 format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/solution-for-choosing-fast-youtube-to-mp4-video-converter-02.jpg)

MP4 files were executed under the ISO/IEC 14496-12:2001 standard by the IEC/ISO and Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG). MP4 is an international specification for audio-visual coding only because of this.

### 02**Pros and Cons of the MP4 format**

One of the critical merits of the MP4 format is that it can be valuable on different platforms.

**●** There are numerous open-source players, such as VLC Media Player, that offer full format support, even used on Linux OS.

**●** It is also versatile. For example, audio files coded with the M4A extension and MPEG-4 visual bitstreams encoded in the M4V extension.

**Cons of the MP4 format**

Note that the format is a container. This means that instead of storing the ode for the file, it keeps the data. Moreover, a specific MP4 file is based upon particular codecs because it does not have a native way of managing the involved coding.

A possible drawback is that there are hundreds of codecs available. Therefore, a media player must run a set of codecs concerning a particular MP4 file.

Yet, because the container format has become widely used, widely-supported codecs have become standards.

**●** Audio can drift out of the way or connect with the video in specific scenarios because of codec-player or codecs compatibility issues.

**●** Because a single file can contain video and audio and different metadata, editing or playback or editing needs various computing resources.

**●** It is still a lossy format. A higher compression format and smaller file size would result in audio and video quality losses.

**●** The familiarity of the MP4 format, coupled with its portability, has also enabled the illegal distribution of copyrighted audio-video files.
