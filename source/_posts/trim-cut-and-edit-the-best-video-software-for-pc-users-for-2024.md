## Choosing the best video trimmer for you; desktop or online?

Choosing an online or desktop video trimmer is a decision only you, as a professional, can make. Still, the truth is desktop trimmers work more efficiently than online solutions for a good number of reasons.

Accuracy: Though online video trimmers might look a bit faster than desktop options, it might not give the flexibility to make changes at will like the desktop options.

Efficiency: If you enjoy working without an internet connection, or have issues with a reception where you reside, then the online video trimmers are not for you.

Space: However, online versions are best suited for people using PCs with low storage space and saving space and time. However, if you want to edit generally and not just trim videos alone, most desktop options come with other editing features than trim.

Speed: Also, because you do not have to wait for an internet signal, desktop video trimmers render faster than online video trimmers (though still depending on system speed).

Verdict: It will be best to try desktop video trimmers for major projects. Online solutions are online cool while either doing a test project or for personal use.

## Conclusion

● The fact remains that the efficiency of your editing software or tool has a huge influence on your productivity. And even though choosing the best video trimmer for your next project might seem dicey, following a simple review like this will make it easy to select from the best and try to know what works best for you.

Windows Media Player offers a clean and intuitive interface, outstanding performance, particularly with big media libraries, and solid integration with Urge, the company's de facto music streaming service. Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.

Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.

**How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?**

**Step 1:** Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in **Now Playing** status to reveal the _playback settings_.

**Step 2:** To continually repeat the movie, click the **Turn Repeat On** button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.

(**Note:** If you don't see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square **Maximize** symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).

**Step 3:** Until you exit the application or click the **Turn Repeat Off** icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.

![play video in loop windows media player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-in-loop-windows-media-player.jpg)

 **Note:** When you close the window, your prior feature selection is retained; thus, the next video you watch will play in a loop until you turn off the **Repeat** feature.

### 2\. [QuickTime Player](https://support.apple.com/downloads/quicktime)

QuickTime Player is a basic application that allows you to watch videos and record screencasts on your Mac. You may also produce your videos and audio recordings and do rapid changes. Basic activities such as video flipping and clip splitting are included in edits.

You can record a screencast of a lecture, or capture a portion of the screen with QuickTime, which is ideal for creating a video lesson for an application. Using QuickTime, you may cut the length of video clips or merge many pieces into a single film. Drag the clips to a film window - QuickTime dynamically scales or trims them to fit the size of the movie.

It can also play your video on loop. Here's how:

 **Note:** When you close the window, your prior feature selection is retained; thus, the next video you watch will play in a loop until you turn off the **Repeat** feature.

### 2\. [QuickTime Player](https://support.apple.com/downloads/quicktime)

QuickTime Player is a basic application that allows you to watch videos and record screencasts on your Mac. You may also produce your videos and audio recordings and do rapid changes. Basic activities such as video flipping and clip splitting are included in edits.

You can record a screencast of a lecture, or capture a portion of the screen with QuickTime, which is ideal for creating a video lesson for an application. Using QuickTime, you may cut the length of video clips or merge many pieces into a single film. Drag the clips to a film window - QuickTime dynamically scales or trims them to fit the size of the movie.

It can also play your video on loop. Here's how:

**How to Loop Video with QuickTime Player?**

If you're using a Mac and wish to generate a video loop in QuickTime Player, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Launch the **QuickTime** player to watch any video.

**Step 2**: In the taskbar at the top right of the screen, select **View**.

**Step 3:** From the drop-down option, select **Loop**. And that's it. You have put a video on loop.

![loop video quicktime player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/loop-video-quicktime-player.jpg)

These two video programs simplify setting up videos to run on repeat; they don't allow you to loop individual video parts. To do so, you'll need more powerful software, such as the well-known VLC Media Player.

### 3\. [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)

The VLC media player is a program that allows you to play video and music files on your computer. The VLC player can operate on several operating systems, including Windows 2021, XP, and Mac OS X, because of the device's powerful CPUs.

This makes the VLC Media Player an excellent alternative for anybody searching for a media player that can simultaneously run many programs. This free video editing program also includes special capabilities that allow it to execute numerous jobs simultaneously, including video editing, data transmission, graphic display, sound editing, and much more.

 **How to Loop a part of the Video in VLC Media Player Continuously?**

Create a beginning point A and an ending point B, which are in the center of VLC's timeline. There is a control button for the A to B looping function in the Advanced Controls. The starting and ending positions inside a media file can be specified by bringing up the advanced controls first. Now follow these steps to put a video on loop in the VLC media player:

**Step 1:** Open the video with VLC media player. Go to **View**. Select the **Advanced Controls** option.

![vlc media player advanced controls option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-media-player-advanced-controls-option.jpg)

**Step 2**: Go to the bottom of the VLC media player, and you will find 4 controls above the play button. Click the third button **Loop from Piont A to Point B continuously** to mark the starting point of the loop; and then click the third button again to mark the end of the loop.

![vlc media player loop part of video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-media-player-loop-part-of-video.jpg)

**Step 3:** Click the Play button and you will find the video is playing loop. Until you press the Loop from point A to point B option for the third time to discontinue the looped playback, the segment of the clip you've put up will keep on playing on loop.

### 4\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

iMovie is a fantastic tool for making beautiful short films, music videos, picture slideshows, and other creative projects. You may also loop videos straight in the iMovie software; however, you'll need to utilize QuickTime to loop movies continually if you want to export them. Here are the quick and easy ways to loop a movie into iMovie.

**How to Loop Video in iMovie?**

**Step 1: Open** iMovie and then the video clip you want to loop in.

**Step 2**: Select the **Loop Playback** option from the **View** menu. Once the video begins to play, it will loop indefinitely until you stop it.

### 5\. [Windows Photos App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4)

Microsoft Photos, a free photo viewer and editor bundled with Windows 10, provides capable image editing and photo improvements and capabilities for organizing and editing movies, all in a touch-friendly interface.

You may doodle on photographs, [apply background music](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [3D effects to videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and use automated object tagging to make searching easier. Microsoft Photos is a wonderful tool for dealing with digital photographs, and for certain users, it may even replace third-party photo applications.

**How to Loop Video in Windows 10 Photos app?**

Windows 10 comes with the Photos app preinstalled. It can also assist you in making your movie loop. Here's how to do it.

**Step 1:** Import your video to the Photos app, and use the trim tool to get the part you want to loop.

![trim video windows 10 photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/trim-video-windows-10-photos.jpg)

**Step 2:** Copy and paste the trimmed video to the storyboard as many times as you like. And then click the Finish Video button to export the video.

![windows 10 photos finish video export](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-10-photos-finish-video-export.jpg)

## Part 2: Create Boomerang Loop with [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Looping a movie is not a difficult chore for anyone, even a novice. As we all know, most video players cease playing when a video approaches its climax. You can manually reverse the portion if you wish to see it with Boomerang effects.

You may loop and enjoy the video you like continuously when you do a new project in [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a video editor for all video content creators.

**Step 2**: Copy and paste the video file on the timeline, and then change the speed of the pasted video to apply the Reverse effect. Repeat the process to loop the video as many times as you want.

**Step 3**: Export the video files when you’re done. Click on **Export** and save the looping video as a video or gif, and then select the location where you want to save the file.
