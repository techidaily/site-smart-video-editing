You can choose from editorial, book and YouTube channel trailer templates or you can start a new project from scratch. Furthermore, Bitable lets you upload footage from social media or cloud storage services. You won’t be able to download finished projects if you opt for the free version of Biteable, and you can only share ten video trailers on social media each month.

All test versions of video trailers are free, but if you want to download them in full HD resolution you must pay a $29.00 one-time fee.
