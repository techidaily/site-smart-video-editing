## **Final Verdict**

VN Video Editor is a mobile-based video editing app. It is an easy and powerful tool to edit all kinds of videos, especially with HD quality. With it, you can trim, crop, merge and rotate your photos, add watermarks, and so much more for both Android and IOS users. However, it does not support some advanced video editing features. If you are looking for such features, you can consider Filmora X Video Editor. It has the most professional features, including Magic Cut, Smart Blur, and other features that you don't find in many other apps.

So, if you edit videos occasionally and don't need many professional results, then you can go for vn video editor apk download. Otherwise, head to the wondershare website and download the Filmora X video editor on your desktop to get professional results.
