It features the drag-n-drop functions and offers almost all the classic video editing functions including trim, rotate, split, combine as well as adding music track, filters, and themes. The windows movie maker is simple yet the function is limited. After you editing one or two vlog videos with it, you will find that.

However,   **Windows Movie Maker** has been discontinued, and it is no longer available for download, but if you are using an older version of the Windows 7 operating system, you can still edit your videos with this iconic PC-based software.

Windows Movie Maker never had much to offer to skilled video editors, so if you take vlogging seriously, you won’t spend too much time editing your videos with it.

**What we like:**

Totally free for windows users and the automatic video creation feature is interesting

**What we don’t like:**

Video Editing Features are limited

Only for Windows users

#### 2. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** MacOS and iOS

iMovie is a free video editing software for vloggers who using Mac to edit vidoes. It is equipped with an array of fantastic and practical video editing features, iMovie is an idea video editing tool for anyone. Comes with every new iMac, it's free of charge and provides a wide range of effects and tools sets, thus it's always considered as an essential tool for any Mac user to enhance their vologs.

Despite a somewhat limited scope of video editing features iMovie provides, the software is still powerful enough to enable you to edit footage captured in resolutions up to **4K** . Additionally, you can [create titles](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [apply visual effects and filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to video clips, or even record your own voiceovers. iMovie’s file sharing capabilities are perfectly suited for vlogging as you can upload a video to your YouTube channel or Facebook account directly from the software.

**What we like:**

Totally free for Mac users and you can also use it on iPhone or iPad to edit vlog videos

**What we don’t like:**

Limited features and effects

Only for Mac or iOS users

#### 3. [VSDC Free Video Editor](http://www.videosoftdev.com/free-video-editor)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows

This non-linear editor seems to be a perfect solution for both established and aspiring vloggers because it offers a lot of video editing tools that are incredibly easy to use. Moreover, the software supports nearly all common image and[video file formats](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) , which means that you can record your vlog entries with any digital camera. The best part is that VSDC enables its users to export videos in HD and 4K resolutions directly to YouTube. The only downside is that you can **only install this vlog editor on a PC computer.**

**What we like:**

Anyone without previous knowledge can use this tool

**What we don’t like:**

Sometimes errors appear when opening the software

#### 4. [GoPro Quik Desktop app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quik-gopro-video-editor/id694164275?mt=8)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows and MacOS

If you're traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.

**What we like:**

It offers cloud storage

**What we don’t like:**

Some good features are paid and expensive

#### 5. [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)

**Price:** Free and premium version

**Compatibility:**  Windows and MacOS

Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.

Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.

**What we like:**

Complete video production tool with audio post-production options

**What we don’t like:**

4K video editing requires a premium version

#### 6. [VN Video Editor](https://www.vlognow.me/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS

Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.

Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.

You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.

So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.

**What we like:**

No watermark and easy to use

**What we don’t like**

No direct download link

Not meant for professional editors

#### 7. [VideoPad](https://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/index.html)

**Price:**  Free and premium version

**Compatibility:**  Mac and Windows OS

Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.

In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.

Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.

**What we like:**

The free version includes lots of exciting features

Affordable upgrade

**What we don’t like:**

Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version

#### 8\. [VideoProc Vlogger](https://www.videoproc.com/video-editing-software/)

A few more features of VideoProc Vlogger include fisheye removal, time-lapse, split screen, green screen, text addition, voice recording, audio extractor, and more.

**What we like:**

100% secure

Free tech – support

Video tutorials available

Minor issues with clips splitting

#### 3. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere/free-trial-download.html)

**Compatibility:** Windows and MacOS

Adobe Premiere is one of the best video editing apps ever created, if not the best, so if you’re looking for a reliable video editor with plenty of advanced video editing features, this is probably your best choice. The seemingly endless collection of tools, visual effects, and animation features will ensure that each video you edit in Adobe Premiere Pro meets the highest professional standards.

![Premiere Pro interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/premiere-pro-interface.jpg)

Vloggers in need of a powerful video editing app that is capable of performing even the most demanding video editing tasks will benefit from purchasing Adobe Premiere Pro as a single app or as a part of some other Creative Cloud plan.

It also supports many[third-party plug-ins](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for additional features.

A broad spectrum of video editing options grants you the creative freedom to visualize any idea, regardless of how complex that idea may be. However, if you are new to Final Cut Pro, you will   **need a lot of practice in order to be able to utilize its capabilities entirely.**

![final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/final-cut-pro-x.jpg "final cut pro")

#### 4. [GoPro Quik Desktop app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quik-gopro-video-editor/id694164275?mt=8)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows and MacOS

If you're traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software.

**What we don’t like:**

Some good features are paid and expensive

#### 5. [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)

**Price:** Free and premium version

Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.

Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.

**What we like:**

Complete video production tool with audio post-production options

**What we don’t like:**

4K video editing requires a premium version

#### 6. [VN Video Editor](https://www.vlognow.me/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS

Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.

Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.

You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.

So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.

**What we like:**

No watermark and easy to use

In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.

Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.

**What we like:**

Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version

## Part 2: How Does Video Compression Work?

Unless you are recording your footage on professional video cameras, chances are that your video clips are already compressed by the time you transfer them to a PC computer and import them into video compression software. Most consumer-level video recording devices are relying on codecs to compress videos while the recording is still in progress.

**Codecs** can either be lossless or lossy, depending on the method utilized to load or discard information that doesn’t change during a recording. The lossy codec formats reduce the size of a video file considerably but they lower the video’s quality, which is why it is better to use lossless codecs if you are recording videos for YouTube and other social media platforms.

## Part 3: What are the Most Common Video Compression and File Size Reduction Methods Utilized by Video Compression Apps?

After the video recording process is completed there a number of methods you can use to **reduce the size of the file** you created. The fastest and the easiest way to compress a video is to **[change its resolution.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** So, if you shot a video in 4K resolution changing its resolution to Full HD will reduce its size.

Most video compressor apps offer **preset output video resolutions** and allow you to change the resolution value manually. Moreover, [changing the file format](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of a video can also lower its size, but if you opt for this method you won’t be able to control how much your videos are going to be compressed.

Besides resolution reduction, you can also **lower a video’s bitrate and frame rate.** As you[reduce the number of frames](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that are displayed every second the size of a video file also shrinks. However, the quality of the video is going to drop as you reduce the number of frames that are displayed each second.

Probably the best way to keep your video files under a certain size limit is to **[shorten their duration](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).** Trimming or cutting out all the parts of a video clip can help you shrink its size, which makes it easier to upload to YouTube or any other social media platform that supports video content.

## **Conclusion**

Compressing video files on Windows 10 is a simple process regardless of the video compressor app you choose. However, the number of the video compression tool you’ll have at your disposal can impact the quality of the output video. That’s why you have to pick a free video compressor for Windows 10 that caters to all your needs.

## Part 2: How Does Video Compression Work?

Unless you are recording your footage on professional video cameras, chances are that your video clips are already compressed by the time you transfer them to a PC computer and import them into video compression software. Most consumer-level video recording devices are relying on codecs to compress videos while the recording is still in progress.

**Codecs** can either be lossless or lossy, depending on the method utilized to load or discard information that doesn’t change during a recording.

Most video compressor apps offer **preset output video resolutions** and allow you to change the resolution value manually. Moreover, [changing the file format](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of a video can also lower its size, but if you opt for this method you won’t be able to control how much your videos are going to be compressed.

Besides resolution reduction, you can also **lower a video’s bitrate and frame rate.** As you[reduce the number of frames](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that are displayed every second the size of a video file also shrinks. However, the quality of the video is going to drop as you reduce the number of frames that are displayed each second.

Probably the best way to keep your video files under a certain size limit is to **[shorten their duration](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).** Trimming or cutting out all the parts of a video clip can help you shrink its size, which makes it easier to upload to YouTube or any other social media platform that supports video content.

## **Conclusion**

Compressing video files on Windows 10 is a simple process regardless of the video compressor app you choose. However, the number of the video compression tool you’ll have at your disposal can impact the quality of the output video.

### 2\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

Another best option in contrast to KineMaster is iMovie. This video editor for Mac permits users to conduct basic video editing quickly. You can also add build-in video effects, transitions to polish your video. iMovie is one cool video editor that can replace KineMaster whenever. This editor device accompanies an exceptionally easy-to-use interface that is friendly for beginners.

Main Features:

* Very simple interface
* Color matching for consistent movie looks
* Classy themes
* Great chroma-keying tool
* Lots of audio tools
* Excellent movie templates

## Conclusion

KineMaster for Mac is a renowned video editing software that offers some pro-level features for both novice and expert. But still, it lacks some exciting features. Be that as it may, we recommend you to get Filmora for your video editing task. It is easy to use and you can edit like a pro quickly.
