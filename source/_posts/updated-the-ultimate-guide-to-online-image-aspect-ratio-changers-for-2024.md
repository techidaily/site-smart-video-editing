## Part 1 Key Facebook Cover Video Specifications

A Facebook cover video works like a mini-advertisement that is played on a loop continuously. To keep the visitors engaged and interested in the video, the video needs to look neat, clean, bright and in the right size and the aspect ratio to fit perfectly in the given space. Key specifications for the cover video are enlisted below.

**Video cover Facebook size**: As such, there are no specific size guidelines issues but it is recommended to keep the size of the video less than 1.75GB. The small size will ensure that users having slower browsing speed can also watch the video in a hassle-free manner.

Dimensions of the video: A video to be used as a cover should be at least 820 X 312 pixels and to get the optimum results it is suggested to keep it around 820 X 462 pixels. If you will watch the video on a desktop, it will be cropped from the sides, or the top or bottom. Thus, to ensure that the video looks perfect on a phone as well as desktop keep the aspect ratio at 16:9 and place the important text or other content at the center.

File type of the video: Videos in MP4 or MOV format are suggested to be used as the cover video and their resolution should be a maximum of 1080p.

Duration of the video: A Facebook cover video can be between 20 seconds to 90 seconds and you can also choose to play it on a loop.

## Part 2 Useful Tips for a Wonderful Cover Video

To make sure that your cover video is interesting, engaging, and uploaded in a hassle-free manner, below listed are some useful tips

**●** Optimizing the video for the mobile phone users: Several times your video may run smoothly on your system but may have issues while playing on a mobile phone. So, keep your texts and important content within the specified size so that even if the video is cropped it does not look awkward.

**●** Go for prompt action: It is always better to get the CTA opportunities whenever available. When something specific is required from a video like increasing traffic, adding more clients, and similar others, let the video prompt to do that and avoid adding too much text.

**●** Audio is not very critical: Though audio can be added to the cover video, it does not have much relevance to the content you wish to showcase to the viewer. By default, the videos on Facebook are muted and also around 85% of the videos are watched without the sound.

**●** Keep the focus on one visual: A Facebook page is already too crowded and thus avoids loading the cover video with too much content. Focus on a single visual which can be text, image, CTA, or other depending on your purpose.

**●** Keep a natural loop: The video will be played on a loop continuously and thus to make it look appealing the starting and the ending should be smooth.
