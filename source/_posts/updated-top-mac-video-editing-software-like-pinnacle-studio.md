## Intelligent Video Reframing: Top Editor Recommendations

The auto-frame feature is needed to edit the videos professionally. Its purpose is to adjust the video clips so that the action of a scene is never out of the frame even after reformatting the video.

Now it's time to take your movie to the next level by adding personalizing and special touches, such as intro/credit, transitions and effects.

 **Intro/credit:**  just like you see in movie theaters and on DVDs, you may want to add an intro at the beginning of your movie that tells people a little bit about your movie and add credits at the end to tell the world who created and starred in it.

Filmora for Mac allows you to caption with more than **200 titles and text styles** with or without animation. To do this, just switch to the Intro/Credit tab and drag the effects to the place where you want it to appear. Then double click and go to “Title” to enter your words or change the Font, Size, and Color of the texts.

**Transition:** You can also add transitions between video and audio clips to make your movie more professional. Just go to the Transition tab and choose from 60+ transition effects.

**Filters:** create a stylish video with stunning filters like camera shake, faux film, material, sepia tone and Instagram-like.

**Effects:** add special effects to videos and pictures on the storyboard will make your movie nicer. To add effects, click the “Power Tool” button in the toolbar to apply effects such as Tilt-Shift, Mosaic and Faceoff. You can also composite a [green screen video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), slow down or fast forward video speed, or play video clips in reverse.

#### 3. Preview and share your movie

When you’re done, save your own movie and share it with others. To do so, hit **“Export”** and select an output method. For your convenience, you can directly upload your shows to YouTube or Vimeo, burn to DVD, or watch on iPod, iPhone, iPad and another mobile devices.

Filmora for Mac also allows you to save the edited video footage to different video formats in different frame rate, bit rate or resolution.
