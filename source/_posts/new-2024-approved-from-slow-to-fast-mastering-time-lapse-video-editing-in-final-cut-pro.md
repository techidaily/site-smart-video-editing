## How to Make a Time-Lapse Video in Final Cut Pro

#### Step 1 Import Clips

Choose **File** \> **New** \> **Event**. Name it and click **OK**. Label the project **Timelapse**. Then go to **File** \> **Import Media**. Browse to source clips folder. Click **Import Selected**. Drop the clips onto the timeline.

#### Step 2 Apply Time-lapse Effect

Click the **Retime** pop-up menu below the viewer and choose **Fast** (or you can access **Modify** \> **Retime** \> **Fast**). There are 4 preset options you can choose: 2x, 4x, 8x, 20x. Or you can customize the speed by selecting **Custom**.

![ Apply Timelapse effect -1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/timelapse-in-fcp-1.png)

You can set any speed by adjusting the **Rate**. Reset the speed by clicking on the little arrow on the right side of the window.

![ Apply Timelapse effect -2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/timelapse-in-fcp-3.png)

You can also drag the retiming handle to adjust the speed: dragging to the left increases the speed, and dragging to the right decreases it.

**Note:** To set speed separately for different parts of one clip, you can choose **Blade Speed** first, and then blade the clip where you want to set different speeds.

## Part 1: What is WhatsApp Status?

WhatsApp is a messaging application that allows you to interact with friends and family members all around the world in real-time. Contacts can see your current location and if you are online at any given time.

Sending free messages to contacts all over the world is made possible through the usage of WiFi or a network connection using WhatsApp. In WhatsApp, you may set a status, which informs your relatives and friends about your whereabouts and whether or not you are online so that they can view the messages.

WhatsApp Status is a status update that is only visible for 24 hours after it is uploaded. You can send pictures, videos, text, links, and animated GIFs to other people. Knowing how to use Instagram Stories will make you feel right at home in no time at all. WhatsApp Status is activated only between two people, who have each other's contact information saved in their address books; this happens by default. Your Status message will not be seen by anyone if you do not have their phone number saved in your contacts.
