 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

There is no doubt that Smartphone cameras can capture videos in breathtaking quality, but using a phone as a camera still has its challenges. The footage recorded with a Smartphone can often be shaky, especially if you’re shooting handheld or it can just contain parts that you don’t want to share with your followers on social media. In 2024, you can edit all videos immediately after you capture them, but in order to do that, you first need to discover a **vlog editor app**  that you really like using. That’s why we are going to take you through some of the best apps you can use to quickly edit your vlogs before you publish them on your iPhone or Android phones.

There are thousands of video editing software for Windows and Mac, Filmora [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) should be on the list since it provides all the basic editing tools that you need to edit a vlog video as well as plentiful pre-programmed video effects and templates and royalty-free music tracks and sound effects. Download the free trial version and have a try.

FAQs about Vlogging Apps

1. **What is the best app for vlogging?**

There are many video editing apps that you can use on both a mobile device or a desktop computer. If you’re editing vlog videos on iPhone, you can use the free built-in iMovie. If you are using Android to vlog, you can try Filmora. For vloggers who prefer to edit videos on a Windows or Mac computer, I recommend Filmora because of the resources and effects.

1. **Can I vlog with my phone?**

Yes, of course, you can vlog with your iPhone or Android phone. In recent days, most phones are equipped with a high-quality camera, and with the help of some camera shoot apps and video editing apps, you can totally record, edit and upload vlog videos on your phone.

1. **Which video editing software do vloggers use?**

There is no best for all. For vloggers in different stages, I recommend different editing software. For beginners who did not have any editing experience, I recommend you to try the pre-programmed video editing apps, such as Windows 10 Photos or iMovie. For those who are looking for a more powerful editor, I recommend Filmora because of its editing tools and plentiful effects and resources.
