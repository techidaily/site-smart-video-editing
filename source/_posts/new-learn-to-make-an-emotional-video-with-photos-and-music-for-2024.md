## Top 5 Final Cut Pro editing tips

The major criteria that differentiate simple editing tools and Final Cut Pro is the speed as in FCP users are able to stream knowledge into tricks within a few minutes. Things that make FCP one of the best tools for video editing needs are discussed as below:

#### 1.Favourites and Keyword first

With FCP, it is possible to add keywords to your videos in much easier manner. Users simply need to press Command K for bringing up required keywords on timeline. The predefined keywords of your media file are also organized with control shortcuts. You can go to favourites option from drop down menu directly and the clips can be shorted as well as organized with easy-to-use collections on the left side.

#### 2.Custom Keyboard shortcuts for hidden features

Keyboard shortcuts can provide faster support to some common actions and this feature is well equipped in FCP. For example, it is possible to use H and G as shortcut commands to initiate the action of Trim End and Trim Start. You will be glad to know that FCP allows customization for shortcuts that means you can add something more than the default keys as per need. Simple go to Final Cut Pro and then visit Commands; here you need to click on Customize and soon you will be able to assign different keys for required tasks.

#### 3.Live Trimming

But the special feature is the adjustment layer that helps to maintain shooting space of camera and apply automatic correction filters on footage so that every clip can be corrected individually with perfect colour blending.

To join several MP4 video files into one, you just need to place all the video files on the timeline, adjust the order and hit "Create" to export it.
