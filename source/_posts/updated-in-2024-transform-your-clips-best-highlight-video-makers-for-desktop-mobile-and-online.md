## What’s the Difference Between a Video and a GIF?

GIFs are very popular among digital marketers (and anybody who uses the internet). These little bursts of repeating material may breathe new life into otherwise dull blog posts, emails, web pages, infographics, and other documents. Isn't it thrilling?

## Notice and Tips When Converting Video to GIF

### Choosing software to save a video as a GIF

All operating systems have a way to convert video to GIF, as you can see in this article. All you have to do now is choose the right one. In a nutshell, here's how you choose the right platform for your GIFs:

**Usability:**The video to GIF platform you use should be simple to use. You want a high-performance converter that's also simple to use.

**Tools:** The platform should have all of the tools you'll need to make an intriguing GIF, such as speed modification, filters, subtitles, and more.

**Quality:** To avoid pixelation, your platform must be able to make GIFs with a high resolution.

**Speed:**Because you don't want to waste time waiting for your file to save, the speed at which the video converts to GIF is also significant.

## Bottom Line

GIF files are efficient when played in browsers and provide good visual quality. GIFs are now often used to show How-To instructions and post memes on social media sites such as Facebook.

However, a quality video to GIF converter is a must-have tool. You can obtain more control over the source material and the created outputs using professional software rather than free web services. Download Wondershare Filmora today to enjoy the handy video to GIF conversion features that will give you the best experience.
