# 10 Best Free Online Video Compressors \[No Download\]

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Videos you record with your iPhone, iPad or any other camera can often be larger than 1GB, especially if they were captured in high resolution. Some social networks have **video size limitations**, so if your video exceeds the platform’s video size limitation you have to **compress that video** to meet the specifications of a particular social network.

Previously, we’ve introduced some of the [best free video compressor apps for iOS](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [Android](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), as well as some [video compression software for Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Mac, in this article, we will take you through the ten **best free online video compressors** which allow you to [compress videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) wherever and whenever.

In fact, you can perform this task online for free regardless of the operating system you’re using. Let’s take a look at the ten **best free online video compressors**.

This [web-based video editing app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), enables its users to optimize their videos for different purposes by **using templates**. Besides making the video editing process easier, Clipchamp **converts, records and compresses video files**. This video compressor lets you **reduce the size without losing the quality** of all videos saved in MP4, MOV or AVI file formats.

![clipchamp compressed video interface  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clipchamp-online-video-compression-finish.jpg)

To change the size of a video with Clipchamp you just have to **choose high, medium or low video quality option** from the Customize Settings menu. Besides, you can also[customize the video resolution](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and format.

After compression, you can upload and share the video to YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook and Google Drive directly or download it to computer. The free version of Clipchamp will **watermark video you compressed at the beginning and ending frames**, and if you want to [remove the watermark from a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you have to upgrade to the Business version of the video editor.

**Pros**

* Offers a huge **selection of templates**

![aconvert online video compressor  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/aconvert-online-video-compressor.jpg)

To start compressing a video with AConvert you have to navigate to the **Video window** and then import a video from your hard drive or from a file hosting service like Dropbox. The Target Format drop-down menu lets you **choose from a variety of output video file formats**, like AVI, MP4 or MOV. Afterward, you should select to **change Video Size, Bitrate, Frame Rate or Video Aspect settings** from the Options drop-down menu and proceed to select the new resolution from the Video Size menu.

 Many people have camcorders and shoot a lot of movies and want to preserve home movies for long lasting memories. If you'd like to make some home movies that can be treasured and liked by the families, try to follow the home video editing tips below.

## Home video editing tips for better home movie making

### 1\. Know your camcorder well

 Make sure that you are very familiar with your camcorder before recording so that you can shoot good videos and photos. If you are not, read the manual and practice shooting before you going to shoot the videos for your home movie.

### 2\. Make a home movie plan

 Keep in mind what your home movie is going to be adorable and pay much attention to the content. And when you record the videos, take the plan into consideration. By doing this, you can make your home movie more coherent.

### 3\. Shoot good videos

 Make sure your videos have plenty of light and are not blurry. And be conscious of the background sound, and try to control it as much as possible. Besides, try to shoot scenes from different angles.

### 4\. Add video editing effects

 When you are editing your movies using some [video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can trim, split, rotate, split videos before or after using the PIP, Jump-cut, Face Off effects, but do not use too many transition effects.

### 5\. Combine photos and videos together

 To make your home video more advanced, you can insert some still photos to the videos or use some advanced video effects such as [picture in picture effect in iMovie](/imovie/imovie-picture-in-picture.html). They will surely make you video more interesting.

### 6\. Don't make the home video too long

 Most home videos are long and boring. However, people usually don't like to see very trifle. So make your home video short, sweet and attractive. Get the best scenes and discard those trivial things.

### 7\. Get some humor

 Successful TV commercials are with good humor and make people happy. Adding some humor to your home videos will bring them to the next level instantly. You can find some funny video online and find some inspirations from them on how to make the video funny and attractive.

 Remember that great home videos should be short, funny, tight and easy to watch. Here are just simple home video editing tips.
