Effects such as Sketch, Ink Outlines, or Cutout can all be used during this process, and you can also combine several effects while turning a photo into a cartoon. Needless to say, inexperienced photo editors can find this task overwhelming, because it requires a lot of patience and excellent knowledge of the software’s features.

### 9\. [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/)

**Compatibility:** macOS

There is no quick or simple way to cartoon a photo with Pixelmator Pro since this image editor doesn’t offer any cartoon effects that can be easily applied to a photo. So, in order to cartoon a photo with Pixelmator Pro you’ll have to place the photo you’re turning into a cartoon onto a blank layer and then outline the figure in the photo.

This process can be very slow, especially if the person you are outlining has long hair or wears a sweater that has a wrinkled sleeve. Once you are done with this step you can proceed to paint the figure using the Color Fill tool. It is important to be patient and go through this stage of the process slowly in order to avoid making mistakes.
