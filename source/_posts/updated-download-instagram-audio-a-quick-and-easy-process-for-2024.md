Days are gone when vertical video were said to be shameful content. These days vertical videos are widely used and they also have a market on social media. But before you are creating these videos vertically, you need to be very careful about the things. Here are some tips that can make your vertical videos even better:

**Aspect ratios:** The **Aspect ratio for social media**plays a major role in the success of the videos. This is the reason why aspect ratios are must to understand. As far as vertical videos are concerned it can be said that the aspect ratio can be anything just greater than 1:The most recommended aspect ratio for vertical video is 9:16 as it covers the whole screen and also it is more immersive.

**Stay closer to the subjects:** When you are shooting your videos in a vertical frame then it can make easier for you to stay closer to your subjects. As people will be scrolling through the application then your video will be at the center. Sometimes, these videos are cut awkwardly. If you shoot the video properly then you can keep yourself away from such issues.

**Grab the attention:** users on social media spend no time to switch to another content or other version of the particular content. This is why it becomes so important to catch the attention of your viewers immediately. Try to keep the first couple of moments exceptionally engaging. This will boost the attention of the audience and also make them stay on your video.

**Rule of third can benefit you:** If you are wishing to follow this rule then it is important to know the reason behind this rule. This rule means that you should not keep the subject or object directly in front of the frame. This can look ugly and will not suit every time. Instead of this, you can make the use of imaginary vertical and horizontal lines to create better and interesting composition. This will make you frame divided into thirds. Your subject can be placed on these lines or in between the lines where they are meeting. You can get the feature of using the grid as a guide in most of the cameras and phones.

## Part4: Motion Blur Effect in Filmmaking

Motion Blur is one of the essential effects to add when you are making a movie. It exaggerates the motion in a perfect way which is necessary for most action movies. This blur effect is usually the result of something moving quicker than the camera. The more significant the speed difference between the camera filming and the moving object, the more pronounced motion blur will be.

In the majority of the cases, it is best to apply motion blur on background objects than the subjects. For example, motion blur is perfect for the shots in which the camera moves at the same speed as the subject. Although, if the subject is moving faster than the camera, you would want a minimal blur.

Technically speaking, more excellent motion blur can be obtained through a lower shutter speed or vice versa. Ensure that your shutter speed is always twice your framerate because anything lower can result in unnatural-looking footage. The famous bike chase of Star Wars Episode VI is a perfect example of the productive application of motion blur. The scene was captured by walking in the forest and shooting a single frame per time.

## Conclusion

Most of the videos need a significant amount of blur to make them look realistic. FCPX is excellent editing software, but it does not have blurring effects. However, there's a way to add blur effect in FCPX, but many people are unaware of it.

To tackle this problem, we came up with different plugins for Motion Blur and its effects in filmmaking. So, now you have in-depth knowledge of how you can add blur effects in FCPX.

## Part2: How to Do Motion Blur in Easy Way?

The motion needs a sufficient amount of blur. It happens with our natural perception as well. For example, if something moves too quickly, it appears blur to our eyes. So, it must be the right amount of blur.

To tackle this problem, we add motion blur to make it look more natural and reality based. It provides the natural smearing we see when something moves too quickly but not when shooting the video. To add this effect, you can use powerful editing software such as Wondershare Filmora. Follow the below steps to add a blur effect to your video on Filmora.

## Part4: Motion Blur Effect in Filmmaking

Motion Blur is one of the essential effects to add when you are making a movie. It exaggerates the motion in a perfect way which is necessary for most action movies. This blur effect is usually the result of something moving quicker than the camera. The more significant the speed difference between the camera filming and the moving object, the more pronounced motion blur will be.

In the majority of the cases, it is best to apply motion blur on background objects than the subjects. For example, motion blur is perfect for the shots in which the camera moves at the same speed as the subject. Although, if the subject is moving faster than the camera, you would want a minimal blur.

Technically speaking, more excellent motion blur can be obtained through a lower shutter speed or vice versa. Ensure that your shutter speed is always twice your framerate because anything lower can result in unnatural-looking footage. The famous bike chase of Star Wars Episode VI is a perfect example of the productive application of motion blur. The scene was captured by walking in the forest and shooting a single frame per time.

## Conclusion

Most of the videos need a significant amount of blur to make them look realistic. FCPX is excellent editing software, but it does not have blurring effects. However, there's a way to add blur effect in FCPX, but many people are unaware of it.

To tackle this problem, we came up with different plugins for Motion Blur and its effects in filmmaking. So, now you have in-depth knowledge of how you can add blur effects in FCPX.
