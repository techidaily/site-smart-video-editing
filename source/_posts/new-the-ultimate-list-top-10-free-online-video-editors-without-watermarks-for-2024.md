## Part 1: What to Consider When Choosing an Online Video Editor

Each video editor listed below has its distinct features. Here are the factors to consider when choosing an online video editor.

#### 1. Pricing

Whereas some online video editors are absolutely free, to others payment is a must to access no watermark option. It may be financially draining to subscribe to a $49.99/month plan. Then, why not opt for the $9.99/month if you have to?

It’s critically important to weigh your financial strengths. However, the features included in the paid plans and the video purpose determine how much to spend.

#### 2. Features

The attractiveness and video theme are better actualized by the features you use. Can you spot “no watermark” indicated anywhere within the features? Whether your edited videos will show with editor labels or watermarks is determined by the online video editor’s features.

Choosing an online video editor with cloud-based storage full of royalty-free videos and templates helps save time and simplifies editing procedures.

#### 3. Ease of Use

Some online video editors are so complex that you’ve to tutorials and guides before starting to edit. You don't have to spend 2 hours editing a 10-minute video.

Before you can begin to use any video editor, consider evaluating the complexity of all features to use. How to import images and share edited videos to social media and websites should be given first priority during the evaluation process.

#### 4. Purpose of the Video

Creating and editing commercial videos require an online video editor with features designed with a business theme. You cannot choose an editor with watermarks and yet you are advertising a different product.

Tutorial videos are usually above 8 minutes and the voice should be as clear as possible. Some video editors and plans are limited to a 5-minute video.

## Part 1: What to Consider When Choosing an Online Video Editor

Each video editor listed below has its distinct features. Here are the factors to consider when choosing an online video editor.

#### 1. Pricing

Whereas some online video editors are absolutely free, to others payment is a must to access no watermark option. It may be financially draining to subscribe to a $49.99/month plan. Then, why not opt for the $9.99/month if you have to?

It’s critically important to weigh your financial strengths. However, the features included in the paid plans and the video purpose determine how much to spend.

#### 2. Features

The attractiveness and video theme are better actualized by the features you use. Can you spot “no watermark” indicated anywhere within the features? Whether your edited videos will show with editor labels or watermarks is determined by the online video editor’s features.

Choosing an online video editor with cloud-based storage full of royalty-free videos and templates helps save time and simplifies editing procedures.

#### 3. Ease of Use

Some online video editors are so complex that you’ve to tutorials and guides before starting to edit. You don't have to spend 2 hours editing a 10-minute video.

Before you can begin to use any video editor, consider evaluating the complexity of all features to use. How to import images and share edited videos to social media and websites should be given first priority during the evaluation process.

#### 4. Purpose of the Video

Creating and editing commercial videos require an online video editor with features designed with a business theme. You cannot choose an editor with watermarks and yet you are advertising a different product.

Tutorial videos are usually above 8 minutes and the voice should be as clear as possible. Some video editors and plans are limited to a 5-minute video.

![Accepted aspect ratios on YouTube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/youtube-aspect-ratio-2.jpg)

### 02What Is the Best Size For a YouTube Video/YouTube Image Sizes?

It is important to know that the **YouTube ratio for** videos and images may vary. However, the size is not only meant by the dimensions. Resolution and aspect ratio are also equally important for having the perfect size of the video and images. When you talk about the videos, the best dimension and resolution is considered to be 1080 by 1920p. Similarly, the aspect ratio for these videos is 16:When you create short video on YouTube then this youtube **shorts aspect ratio** remains the same because videos in this resolution and aspect ratio perform the best as they are in full HD.

Talking about videos, YouTube images cannot be neglected. If you will not follow the recommended size of YouTube images then you may have to face issues in posting them. YouTube images are at best when they are posted in the perfect size. Banner images on YouTube must be posted in the size of 2560 by 1440 pixels. Size of images may also change depending on the device that you are using. This can be different on desktops and tablets accordingly. On desktops, the size is 2560 by 423 and on tablets, the size becomes 1855 by 423.

### 03What Is the Best Frame Rate For a YouTube Video?

Frame rate is another important aspect to focus on when you are taking about posting content on YouTube. This is so important because without frame rate your video will not get the desired quality. It is must to know thing that video which you are posting must be in the actual and same frame rate in which it has been recorded. The most common frame rates for YouTube videos are 24, 48, 30, 25 and 60\. However you can post the videos in any other frame rate but these are recommended the most.

It is equally important to deinterlace the content before you are posting it. This means if your video has 1080i60p and you want to convert it into 1080i30p then you will need to change the frame rate first.

![Accepted formats on YouTube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/youtube-aspect-ratio-4.jpg)

## Part 2 How to Make Your Videos Look Their Best?

### 01The Right YouTube Dimensions

![best dimension for YouTube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/youtube-aspect-ratio-5.jpg)

### 02Ways to Change YouTube Video Sizes

As a YouTube user, you have the option to change the video sizes and resolution so that you can get a vivid viewing experience of your videos. This may also boost the audience number on your videos. To change the video size of YouTube, you will just need to follow some simple steps that are mentioned here:

**Step 1:** First of all, you will have to open the video whose size you want to change. After this you will have to open the setting option from the icons that are displayed below the video.

**Step 2:** After opening the settings icon, you will find the option of quality. Choose that option and there you will see a list of dimensions amongst which you have to choose the one in which you wish to put your video. For example it may be 720p or less and more.

**Step 3:** As soon you choose the dimension or resolution the next step you have to do is go for it and click on save option and your video size is changed.

### 03How to Record YouTube Videos with the Right Dimensions

As you know the most familiar **YouTube video aspect ratio** is 16:9, so the videos cannot be created in the vertical mode. Keep in mind that you create the videos in horizontal mode. This will look professional as well as will boost your video quality too. Also it is worth considering that the video dimensions matter a lot when you are creating the videos. Do consider the device that you are using to create the video as many devices can create the videos in the highest resolution possible.

 You must also know that videos with higher dimension and resolution need more space so before making the videos do have a check on your storage space too. It is also a good idea to maintain the balance between high quality videos and your storage space.

### 04How to Create YouTube Thumbnails That Get More Clicks

Every video creator wishes that his videos get more views. This is only possible when you will have excellent and engaging thumbnails so that they get more clicks. Here are some ideas that you can opt for your video thumbnail in order to get it more audience and views:

**●** **Go for video still:** It will be an interesting idea to add video still to your YouTube videos. By doing so you can give your audience an excitement about what they are going to experience. Video still can do the work of giving a glance to your audience and afterwards if they will see the similar things then they will be satisfied about what your deliver to them.
