Adobe Premiere Pro offers different paths to importing and exporting videos. Here we mainly discuss how to import and export media files in Adobe Premiere Pro.

Learn more [tips, tricks and hacks](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of Premiere for accelerating video editing.

This is a basic tutorial about Adobe Premiere, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

## Importing

There are two main ways to import media into Premiere, the import command and the media browser. They do things slightly differently and have uses they are both best suited to, here we will look at the process itself and which method to use in a given situation.

#### 1\.  Import Command

This is a straightforward command that works like most other programs, and is accessed from the file menu, or via the Control+I shortcut on the PC or Command+I on the Mac. You can also double click an empty area of the project panel to automatically open the import dialogue.

Whichever way you access it, you get the standard for the platform import dialogue box we see here.

![Import videos to Adobe Premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-1.jpg)

This method of importing is best suited to self-contained media such as audio or graphics, or video files such as MP4 that are single files themselves, whose location on your computer you know so you can navigate to them easily. This is not the way to import videos from cameras, as they invariably create complex file and folder arrangements that make choosing the correct files difficult. This is where you would opt for the media browser method instead.

#### 2\.  Media Browser

Whilst on the surface media browser appears to do the same job as the import command the way they carry out the task is somewhat different, media browser is designed to let you see the media created by cameras, and show you easy to understand icons and metadata rather than the intricate pattern of files and folders they use. This makes picking the correct clip from a selection much easier, with metadata showing you date and duration as well as file type.

![Import videos to Adobe Premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-2.jpg)

The media browser panel is found in the project panel, which on the standard layout is the bottom left corner, and can also be accessed by the Shift+8 shortcut. As you can see from the screenshot it works like an operating system file browser and allows you to navigate through the file directories of hard drives and removable media connected to the system.

One of the benefits of media browser is to narrow down the type of media being shown, so you can set to avchd for instance and it will display just that type of file in a given location. Because many projects use media from different sources this can be a real boon to finding the right file within a list.

#### File Types

Media browser displays more or less any file there is in a given location, and importing is simply a matter of selecting the correct file and double clicking it or right clicking and selecting import from the menu. You can select multiple files at once by holding down shift and import them all together if needed.

There are some exceptions to this, however, despite having a huge number of file types supported natively within Premiere, you will sometimes run into files that are not supported, FLV and MKV files being the most common ones, but this is not the end of the world and there is a simple solution.

[Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/) offers an easy way to convert any file you may have into media that Premiere can use quickly and efficiently, and is a great tool to have alongside premiere if you commonly work with multiple file types.

## Exporting

The ultimate aim of any project is obviously to finish it and let others see the result of your creativity, and that means exporting your work into a format that is suitable for the medium you wish the project to be viewed on. Premiere offers a number of options regarding export, you can select an entire sequence to export as a single file for the web or disc, choose a single frame to post to a website, blog or to distribute through email, you can export just the audio, or just the video from a sequence, and if you have the right hardware, can export directly to tape or disk.

To export a project that closely matches the original media in quality and frame rates, often called a master copy, is very straightforward in Premiere, with the sequence selected, either in the Timeline Panel or the Project Panel, you simply use the File > Export > Media path :

![Export videos in Adobe Premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-3.jpg)

Which opens the media export dialogue.

![Export videos in Adobe Premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-4.jpg)

Selecting 'Match Sequence Settings' here creates a finished file that matches the quality of the original source media. Then you simply choose a suitable name for the file in the Output Name field, and click export. This creates in essence a digital clone of the sequence, and best practice is to always do this for any project, however, for many projects, this is not necessarily the format you would want the final product to be in, those concentrating on YouTube output, or someone wanting to author a DVD for instance will need other options.

Thankfully Premiere caters here as well. Instead of selecting the 'Match Sequence Settings' within export dialogue, you can click on the 'Format' field to change the type of file that is produced. What options here can vary depending on codecs installed, this screenshot shows only those that are included with the product for clarity.

![Export videos in Adobe Premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-5.jpg)

Depending on which format you choose. The preset below will allow you to choose a wide range of output settings to suit the intended platform. For instance, selecting  format brings up a huge number of presets for various Tablets and Phones, but also for Vimeo and YouTube, which is why it is one of the most common output formats. Here's a look at some of the presets available from the menu.

![Export videos in Adobe Premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-6.jpg)

Once you choose a preset, you can further modify the parameters to suit the project you are working on and even save those as an additional custom preset for later projects should you wish. Again, choosing a suitable file name and clicking Export ends the process.

The other common requirement is for DVD or Blu-Ray files. Whilst you need access to the appropriate hardware to burn the disk, Premiere creates the file structure for that natively and you have two options here. Mpeg2 in either DVD or Blu-Ray form, or  Blu-Ray. With high quality source material, the two formats are virtually indistinguishable in their final format, however, MPEG2 will be much quicker to render and is a good choice for most applications. Although  does allow more content to fit into a given space, so it does have uses. Importing and exporting are the foundation of Premiere use, and as we have shown Premiere makes it very easy to do and produces the right file types for whatever your project is to be used for.

With the addition of [Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/) you have a workflow that can ingest and export any type of media file you will ever come across with the minimum of fuss.

Whilst you need access to the appropriate hardware to burn the disk, Premiere creates the file structure for that natively and you have two options here. Mpeg2 in either DVD or Blu-Ray form, or  Blu-Ray. With high quality source material, the two formats are virtually indistinguishable in their final format, however, MPEG2 will be much quicker to render and is a good choice for most applications. Although  does allow more content to fit into a given space, so it does have uses. Importing and exporting are the foundation of Premiere use, and as we have shown Premiere makes it very easy to do and produces the right file types for whatever your project is to be used for.

With the addition of [Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/) you have a workflow that can ingest and export any type of media file you will ever come across with the minimum of fuss.

Finally, we've gotten to the part where we introduce all the best **Facebook Audio Converter** websites available! These are all online tools that you can visit and use (in much the same way described in the two tutorials above) in order to turn your Facebook video into an MP3!

### 01**Facebook Video Downloader**

Facebook Video Downloader is the first of the **Facebook MP3 Converters** on this list. The URL for it has been provided below! And, as you can see from the image provided, you can use it by pasting the direct URL of the Facebook video that you want to convert and then pressing the 'Download' button!

![Facebook Video Downloader - Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%209.png)

![MP3CONV Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2010.png)

### 03**O Downloader**

The O-Downloader (Facebook Downloader) is simpler than the previous two that we introduced. For one, it can only convert videos from Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram. Its conversion options are also limited to MP3 and MP4! However, aside from those differences, you use it pretty much how you would use any online video converter — paste the link and click 'Download'!

![O-Downloader Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2011.png)

![X2Convert Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2012.png)

![Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2013.png)

## Part 4 **Top 8 Facebook Mp3 Converter Online**

For this next section, we've gathered up a couple of other **Facebook MP3 Converter**s that you can use! This time, however, we've also attached a Youtube video from which you can learn how to use said converter! And, even more importantly, we've varied things up a bit — including not just online converters, but also plug-ins and software.

### 01**Getfvid**

Getfvid makes it to the top of our list for its sheer popularity! This is the **Facebook MP3 converter** that many people defaulted to. It is, after all, an completely FREE video converter. And, just like the other Facebook video downloaders, we introduced in the previous section, it's pretty easy to use as well!

### 02**Online Video Converter**

Online Video Converter is another online conversion tool that you might want to consider. Compared to some of the other online converters out there, it is packed with lots of features (allowing you to download Facebook audio but also audio from many other social media platforms and websites. Plus, converting in a variety of formats!)

### 03**AceThinker**

AceThinker makes our third online **Facebook MP3 converter** on this list. It works just like the rest and offers a couple of extra features on top of that (which includes multiple formats for conversions and, also, the ability to download and convert videos to audio from other sites.)

### 04**Wondershare Filmora**

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is the first and only **Facebook MP3 Converter** software on this list!

### 05**Flash Video Downloader (Plug-In)**

The next **Facebook audio converter** is also different from the norm! After all, it's a plug-in! More specifically, it's a chrome extension that you can download (for free) from the Chrome web store and install into your browser! It's obviously a lot different from the other converters that we've introduced thus far, but it works just as well! If you want to learn more, check out the YouTube video, where the process is explained in more detail.

### 06**Video Downloader Professional (Plug-In)**

Next, we have another chrome extension in the form of 'Video Downloader Professional'! This plug-in, just like the previous one, is available for Chrome browsers and you can use it to download media (including Facebook audio) whenever you want.

### 07**Stream Recorder (Plug-In)**

Stream Recorder is our third and final chrome extension in this list! This one is a bit different though! Mainly because, rather than instantly downloading media, you have to turn it on and let the media play (in order to record it!) It's mainly used for recording live streams (but it works on Facebook, so you can use it as a **Facebook audio converter** if that is what you need.)

### 08**Apowersoft**

With Apowersoft, we go back to the most common type of online converter! It's the perfect place to round us off. After all, it is very similar to the other converters we introduced in the beginning!

## Part 2 **How to Download and Convert a Facebook Video Online**

Next up, we'll be going through the entire process once more. However, this time, we'll be teaching you how to download and convert a Facebook Video Online. Again, this is pretty easy, all you need is the right **Facebook Audio Converter** and a functional online MP4 to MP3 converter.

**Step 1: Go to Facebook Video!**

Like before, we start with getting the direct URL of your chosen Facebook video! For this, remember to first select the "..." menu!

![Facebook Post Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%205.png)

**Step 2: Copy Facebook Video URL!**

![Use Facebook Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%207.png)

**Step 4: Use MP4 to MP3 Converter!**

![Use Online Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%208.png)

## Part 3 **Best 5 Facebook Mp3 Downloader Online**

Finally, we've gotten to the part where we introduce all the best **Facebook Audio Converter** websites available! These are all online tools that you can visit and use (in much the same way described in the two tutorials above) in order to turn your Facebook video into an MP3!

### 01**Facebook Video Downloader**

Facebook Video Downloader is the first of the **Facebook MP3 Converters** on this list. The URL for it has been provided below! And, as you can see from the image provided, you can use it by pasting the direct URL of the Facebook video that you want to convert and then pressing the 'Download' button! The best part of it is that it has several conversation formats (both for audio and video conversion), including, of course, **Facebook to MP3 Converter (free!)**

![Facebook Video Downloader - Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%209.png)

### 02**MP3Conv**

MP3Conv is another online **Facebook MP3 Converter** that you can use 100% for free. Furthermore, it also works for other sites (including, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit!) The process for using this tool is pretty much the same way as all the rest as well. Just past and click 'Download' to finish!

![MP3CONV Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2010.png)

### 03**O Downloader**

The O-Downloader (Facebook Downloader) is simpler than the previous two that we introduced. For one, it can only convert videos from Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram. Its conversion options are also limited to MP3 and MP4! However, aside from those differences, you use it pretty much how you would use any online video converter — paste the link and click 'Download'!

![O-Downloader Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2011.png)

### 04**X2Convert**

X2 Convert, accordingly, works the same way. It's a **Facebook Audio Converter** that you can use pretty much at any time (for free, no installation or download required.) Just visit the URL provided, paste the link of the video that you want to download, and go!

![X2Convert Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2012.png)

### 05**Youtube 4K Downloader**

The YouTube 4K Downloader tool, despite its name, works as well as your average **Facebook MP3 converter**! As you can see in the image below, they have an option specifically for converting Facebook videos into MP3s!

![Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2013.png)

## Part 4 **Top 8 Facebook Mp3 Converter Online**

For this next section, we've gathered up a couple of other **Facebook MP3 Converter**s that you can use! This time, however, we've also attached a Youtube video from which you can learn how to use said converter! And, even more importantly, we've varied things up a bit — including not just online converters, but also plug-ins and software.

### 01**Getfvid**

Getfvid makes it to the top of our list for its sheer popularity! This is the **Facebook MP3 converter** that many people defaulted to. It is, after all, an completely FREE video converter. And, just like the other Facebook video downloaders, we introduced in the previous section, it's pretty easy to use as well!

### 02**Online Video Converter**

Online Video Converter is another online conversion tool that you might want to consider. Compared to some of the other online converters out there, it is packed with lots of features (allowing you to download Facebook audio but also audio from many other social media platforms and websites. Plus, converting in a variety of formats!)

### 03**AceThinker**

AceThinker makes our third online **Facebook MP3 converter** on this list. It works just like the rest and offers a couple of extra features on top of that (which includes multiple formats for conversions and, also, the ability to download and convert videos to audio from other sites.)

### 04**Wondershare Filmora**

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is the first and only **Facebook MP3 Converter** software on this list! It will require download and installation. And, it's a freemium tool as well. So, you'll have to keep that in mind. However, unlike every other **Facebook audio converter** on this list, it comes with advanced video editing features that will allow you to actually put the audio that you downloaded to use (be it for a special video message, a professional presentation, a fun party video, and so on.)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.12 or later

### 05**Flash Video Downloader (Plug-In)**

The next **Facebook audio converter** is also different from the norm! After all, it's a plug-in! More specifically, it's a chrome extension that you can download (for free) from the Chrome web store and install into your browser! It's obviously a lot different from the other converters that we've introduced thus far, but it works just as well! If you want to learn more, check out the YouTube video, where the process is explained in more detail.

Next, we have another chrome extension in the form of 'Video Downloader Professional'! This plug-in, just like the previous one, is available for Chrome browsers and you can use it to download media (including Facebook audio) whenever you want.

### 07**Stream Recorder (Plug-In)**

Stream Recorder is our third and final chrome extension in this list! This one is a bit different though! Mainly because, rather than instantly downloading media, you have to turn it on and let the media play (in order to record it!) It's mainly used for recording live streams (but it works on Facebook, so you can use it as a **Facebook audio converter** if that is what you need.)

### 08**Apowersoft**

With Apowersoft, we go back to the most common type of online converter! It's the perfect place to round us off. After all, it is very similar to the other converters we introduced in the beginning!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

Stream Recorder is our third and final chrome extension in this list! This one is a bit different though! Mainly because, rather than instantly downloading media, you have to turn it on and let the media play (in order to record it!) It's mainly used for recording live streams (but it works on Facebook, so you can use it as a **Facebook audio converter** if that is what you need.)

### 08**Apowersoft**

With Apowersoft, we go back to the most common type of online converter! It's the perfect place to round us off. After all, it is very similar to the other converters we introduced in the beginning!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Need a way of converting a Facebook video into an audio file? Well, then you don't have to worry anymore! Hopefully, the tutorials we've provided will be able to help you on your quest!

**●** There are plenty of online Facebook MP3 converters that you can use for this!

**●** Don't hesitate to try out other types of tools as well! Including software, like Filmora Pro, or the chrome extensions that we introduced.

Do you enjoy the view of movies? Do you find your videos dull and unexciting? How about giving a cinematic look to your videos?

I bet a lot of editors have been there. However, it won’t take you long to find out that movies are quite different from the video you recorded and edited.

No worries, this article explains why there are differences between self-made videos and movies, as well as simple yet detailed steps to make cinematic look videos with FCPX.

## **Part 1: Difference between a Cinematic Look and a Normal Video?**

The term cinematic is often referred to the black bars or wide-screen frame ratios. Photographers and filmmakers use the term cinematic to describe the look of movies and pictures shot on film.

However, the term has changed its meaning with the advent of digital video and the invention of high-tech devices. With the evolution of the internet across the globe, YouTubers, videographers, and social media influencers have started using this term to describe anything related to cinema and film. In other words, a cinematic look is an unconventional, film-look, and professional appearance of a video that makes a normal clip look elegant and worth watching. [See the top 10 movies made by FCPX here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![Blade-Runner-2049-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Blade-Runner-2049-poster.png)

So, here we draw a line between a normal video and the one with a cinematic look. In the latter, you adjust everything that is directly or indirectly linked to the quality of a video, including but not limited to **colors**, **appearance**, **light**, **motion**, **frame rate**, **composition**, and **camera** **movements**.

Resolution refers to the horizontal pixel count such as 2K (2.2 megapixels) or 4K (8.8 megapixels). Similarly, the frame rate defines the number of individual images or frames being displayed on the TV screen per second. The universally accepted film frame rate is 24 FPS, which is used to make high-definition videos. However, most TV broadcasts and shows are recorded at 30fps. [See more about FPS here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Thanks to the advanced video editing tools and applications that have made it easier to capture a cinematic look or make HD cinematic look videos with basic camera setups. If you want to get your desired cinematic look, read the following section.

## Part 2: How to Make a Cinematic Look Film Video with FCPX?

The latest features and user-friendly dashboard of Final Cut Pro X allow users (even beginners) to add effects and increase the aesthetics of their videos. Follow these four simple steps to make a cinematic look high-resolution video with Final Cut Pro X.

**Step 1: 4K Resolution and Low Frame Rate**

To achieve ideal cinematic aesthetics, you need high-quality 4K resolution videos, awesome exposure, the right codec, and lighting. Hence, to start with, capture a high-quality 4K Canon RAW shot with the latest high-tech Canon Log 2 camera.

**Step 2: Color Grading and Color Correction**

After importing your footage, get ready for color corrections to address issues like conversions for LOG formats through white balance adjustments. Color corrections normalize the color of HD videos into a standard format. Here’s how you can do this:

1. Go to the Inspector Panel and select the Extended Function
2. Select the C-Log 2 conversion LUT

1. Make minor exposure and white balance adjustments as per your scope
2. Select the Color Wheels and Color Mask features to custom select specific areas and colors
3. Adjust your color grade according to your requirements
4. Use Color Masking to improve the shadow’s appearance and warm-up mid-tones
5. You will get a strong color contrast in your footage.

**Step 3: Use Slow Motion at the Right Timing**

Final Cut Pro X allows its users to make both constant and variable speed changes without disturbing the audio’s pitch. By using slow-motion effects at the right timing, you can make your videos adorable and give them a cinematic look.

* Select your video and click on the Retiming button
* Tap on the Slow section

![slow-motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/slow-motion.png)

* You will see multiple options to slow down the speed of your clip
* The smaller number will slow down your footage
* To apply custom retiming amounts, again click on the Retiming button and select the Custom option
* Custom the speed of your clip over 100% or less than 100% as you want
* After selecting a value, your selected clip will become longer on the timeline.

**Step 4: Adopt Film Grain to Make Film-look Videos**

Film grain overlays give your videos vintage and cinematic look. Follow these steps to use these film grains in Final Cut Pro X:

1. Import your footage and film grains downloaded from the internet and layer them into your timeline

 ![filmgrain](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/filmgrain.png)

## **Part 3: What Other Factors Contribute to Film-Look Videos**

While making cinematic-look videos, also considering the following factors:

**Framing**

While filming, one must be aware of the emotion to be captured in the frame. For this purpose, follow the “Rule of Thirds,” which means to divide your short into three horizontal and vertical sections and select the third shot to produce some effect.

**Tilt Shift**

Instead of shooting your clips with a UHD camera, you can add cinematic effect with the Tilt-shift feature by setting the focus of your video. For this purpose, right-click on the video, select Power Tool and check the box with the option Apply Tilt-shift to the clip. Use the slider to adjust the focus.

**Background Music**

Cinematic clips without background music seem to be unexciting and boring. Adding melodious background music makes your videos look more professional and enjoyable. You can add default music or your favorite music downloaded from the internet by clicking on the Music tab.

**Titles and Subtitles**

Adding subtitles to your videos can make them understandable for viewers who speak a different language. Click on Text/Credit in Filmora and select Subtitles to add subtitles to your video.

## **Part 4: How to Add Cinematic Look to Your Footage in Easy Ways**

Filmora is an advanced video editing tool developed by Wondershare. Its user-friendly and easy-to-understand interface makes it popular among beginners as well as professionals. And the best thing about Filmora is that the editor provides rich options of presets, effects, and filters to add a film look to your video.

## **Part 3: What Other Factors Contribute to Film-Look Videos**

While making cinematic-look videos, also considering the following factors:

**Framing**

While filming, one must be aware of the emotion to be captured in the frame. For this purpose, follow the “Rule of Thirds,” which means to divide your short into three horizontal and vertical sections and select the third shot to produce some effect.

**Tilt Shift**

Instead of shooting your clips with a UHD camera, you can add cinematic effect with the Tilt-shift feature by setting the focus of your video. For this purpose, right-click on the video, select Power Tool and check the box with the option Apply Tilt-shift to the clip. Use the slider to adjust the focus.

**Background Music**
