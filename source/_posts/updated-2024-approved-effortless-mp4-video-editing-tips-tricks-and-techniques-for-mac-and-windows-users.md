MP4 is a very common media format that can keep the high image and sound quality. Many downloaded movies, streaming music videos, or recorded video clips are with .MP4 file extension. Confused about different kinds of formats? Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY1IQUuQBME)to learn what video format is and the differences between video formats.

If you have many such files, chances are that you need to edit MP4 videos.

Although various MP4 editors are available on the market, they are a little space-consuming in order to ensure good performance. Here I'd like to share a powerful and efficient MP4 editor that designed for beginners and hobbyists.

It's Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor). With it, you're able to trim, rotate, crop, merge MP4 files, as well as personalize your MP4 videos with rich text, filter and transitions. Moreover, after you finish MP4 video editing, you can directly share your creation on YouTube, Facebook, or save to any format you want.

## How to Easily Edit MP4 Video?

Before we proceed to illustrate every detail on how to edit the MP4 video, you can download the MP4 editor first so you can follow the below steps one by one.

It's free to download now.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

####

#### 1. Cut MP4 Video

To cut your MP4 video into certain parts, drag and drop the video on the Timeline and highlight it. Then place the red Time Indicator to where you want to cut the video, and click the Scissor button above the timeline.

After that, move the red marker to the end of the scene, and repeat this again to cut the video into several fragments. If you want to cut off the unwanted parts, right click the video and choose "Delete".

![export edited MP4 by cutting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cut-a-section.gif)

####

#### 2. Join MP4 Video

To join several MP4 video files into one, you just need to place all the video files on the timeline, adjust the order and hit "Create" to export it.

If you want to make the joined videos look like a really intact movie, just add transitions between clips for smooth change from one to next. To do this, click "Transition" tab on the main screen. Then drag the effect you like to the timeline to apply.

If you don't want to choose the transition one by one, let the software choose the transition randomly by right clicking and selecting "Random to All" option.

![edit MP4 files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-transition.JPG)

####

#### 3. Edit the audio of MP4 Video

Sometimes you may need to adjust the settings of audio. To do it, double click the video on the Timeline. Then a editing panel will pop up. Switch to the Audio column and you can easily change the Speed, Volume, Pitch of the audio file or add the Fade in/out effect to it.

Want to change the original audio track of your MP4 video?

No problem.

Just highlight your MP4 video, right click and choose "Audio Detach". The audio file of your video will immediately be separated and appear on the music timeline. Since it is separated from the video, you can easily delete the audio track or replace it with your own music.

![edit MP4 audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-audio-volume-keyframe.jpg)

####

The amount of video content uploaded to the Internet each day is staggering, as people around the globe create hundreds of hours of videos daily. As a result, the videos you upload to social media must stand out in this sea of content to get thousands of views, shares, or likes.

**[Speeding up or slowing down the footage](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is a simple and yet effective video editing technique that can make the content you share online more entertaining to watch. Read on if you would like to find out more about **slow and fast motion video apps for iOS and Android** devices you can use to process your footage before posting it on your social media accounts.

## 10 Best Video Speed Changing Apps for iOS and Android

Sharing the raw footage, you capture on a Smartphone with your friends and followers may not always produce the results you’re hoping for. Slowing down the playback speed can make a scene more entertaining or highlight an important moment in your video. Increasing a video’s playback speed is a great option if you want to create breathtaking time-lapses. So, let’s take a look at the **10 best video speed-changing apps for slow and fast motion video editing on iOS and Android devices.**

### 1\. Filmora for mobile

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:** [iOS](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) 11.0 or later, [Android](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) 4.2 and up

[![Download filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/google_play.jpg) ](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) [![Download filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/apple_store.jpg)](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6)

Changing the playback speed of the footage you edit with Filmora takes just a few moments since this cross-platform app enables all of its users to choose how rapidly the frames in each shot will be displayed on the screen.

This app provides a versatile set of video editing tools, enabling you to **enhance the colors in your videos**, make a soundtrack or even **[create a PIP effect](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**. The only downside is that the free version of the app watermarks all videos you export from it, and you must make an in-app purchase in order to remove the watermark from your videos.

**Pros**

* Simple video playback speed adjustment process
* A rich library of visual effects
* Supports all common video file formats
* Versatile color correction tools

**Cons**

* All videos created with the free version of Filmora are watermarked
* Exporting footage in 4K resolution is not an option

### 2\. Vlogit

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:** [iOS 9.0](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vlogit-video-editor/id1270522021) or later, [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wondershare.vlogit&hl=en) 4.3 and up

As its name suggests, this video editing app provides YouTubers and Vloggers with all the tools they need to create the content they share with their followers. As soon as you record a new video clip with your iPhone or Android phone, you can import it into the app and remove all parts you don’t want to include in the final cut.
