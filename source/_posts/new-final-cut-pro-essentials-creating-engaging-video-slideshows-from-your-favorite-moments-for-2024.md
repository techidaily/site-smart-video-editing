## Part 1: How to Create a Video Slideshow in Final Cut Pro?

Final Cut Pro is an amazing software that makes slideshow creation as simple as ABC. You need not use any template; instead, you can sequence images on the timeline and add a few transitions and audio effects to create a video slideshow. Here’s how you can do this:

1. Open Final Cut Pro, go to **File,** and click on **New Project;**
2. Now, it’s time to import the still images you want to use to Final Cut Pro. For this purpose, tap **File > Import > Files** and select all photos from your computer, and click **Import**. Keep selecting until all images have been imported.
3. Go to the **Browser** pane and drag your photos to the Timeline of Final Cut Pro. Make sure you follow the order in which you want these images to appear in the slideshow. You can also drag each image individually and drop it to your desired place before or after other images. The video slideshow will display images in the order they are placed in the Timeline.
4. To add various transitions between your images, take the cursor to the target location in the timeline, go to the **Menu** and click **Effects** and **Video Transitions**. Now select the type of transition you want to add such as **Wipe** or **Fade**. You can also open other transitions from the submenu. This way, your desired effect will appear at your selected location in the Timeline.
5. You can also add audio effects to your video slideshow. For this purpose, click **File > Import > Files.** Now, select your favorite audio file from the FCP’s library or your computer and click Once the audio file has been imported to the Browser pan of FCP, drag that file to the Timeline.
6. To add opening or closing credits, click **Effects > Video Generators.** Now, double-click **Text** and **Text** From the newly opened window, click **Controls** and type your desired text to be displayed in your video slideshow. Now, click **Video** and drag the video box into the Timeline to your desired location where it should appear.
7. To export your video slideshow, click **File > Export > QuickTime Movie.** Based on your requirement, select your desired video quality and click OK.
