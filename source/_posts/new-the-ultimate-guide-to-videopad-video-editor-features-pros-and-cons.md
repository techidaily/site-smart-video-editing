If you're on Mac and want to make a personalized movie from a collection of pictures and videos, you need effective video editing software. **iMovie** might be your first choice since it's free and simple. But you may also want some other apps which can offer you **more features and controls**. Fortunately, there are many alternatives to iMovie in the market.

So, to help you make a movie on Mac easily and quickly, I will show you how to create a movie on Mac with detailed steps.

Movie creator: [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) has a user-friendly and intuitive interface as well as plentiful features. **This software enables you to create custom movies with pictures, music and effects.** You can then watch the movie on your Mac, share with friends or family members, post it on a social networking site or burn it to a DVD. Now check out the steps below to see how to make a movie with it.

## How to make a movie on Mac \[Step by Step tutorial\]

#### 1. Import video/photo/music files to the program

Install and run Filmora for Mac. Choose **"New Project"** to get started. Then click **"Import"** or directly drag and drop your video, photo or music files to the media panel.

You can also use a media browser to get files from your iTunes library, iMovie, etc.

#### 2. Start making your movie

Now it's time to take your movie to the next level by adding personalizing and special touches, such as intro/credit, transitions and effects.

 **Intro/credit:**  just like you see in movie theaters and on DVDs, you may want to add an intro at the beginning of your movie that tells people a little bit about your movie and add credits at the end to tell the world who created and starred in it.

Filmora for Mac allows you to caption with more than **200 titles and text styles** with or without animation. To do this, just switch to the Intro/Credit tab and drag the effects to the place where you want it to appear. Then double click and go to “Title” to enter your words or change the Font, Size, and Color of the texts.

**Transition:** You can also add transitions between video and audio clips to make your movie more professional. Just go to the Transition tab and choose from 60+ transition effects.

You can also composite a [green screen video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), slow down or fast forward video speed, or play video clips in reverse.

#### 3. Preview and share your movie

When you’re done, save your own movie and share it with others. To do so, hit **“Export”** and select an output method. For your convenience, you can directly upload your shows to YouTube or Vimeo, burn to DVD, or watch on iPod, iPhone, iPad and another mobile devices.

Filmora for Mac also allows you to save the edited video footage to different video formats in different frame rate, bit rate or resolution.
