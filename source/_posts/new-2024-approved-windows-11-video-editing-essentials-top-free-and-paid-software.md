# VLC Trimmer Mac: Best Way to Trim VLC Without Losing Quality

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

 Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions

_Is there a way to trim VLC without losing quality?_ Of course! Trimming VLC videos without losing quality can be a bit frustrating sometimes. Fortunately, there are applications available that can help you edit videos without losing quality. Wondershare Filmora is one such software that can be downloaded for free. You cannot miss it.

In this article, we will introduce why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality, then recommend 3 video editors trim high-quality video without lowering the quality.

* [Section 1\. Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality](#why-trim-vlc-loss-quality)
* [Section 2\. Video editor to trim VLC videos without loss of quality](#software-trim-vlc-without-loss-quality)

## Section 1.  Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality?

To understand quality loss, you first need to understand codecs, containers, and video re-encoding. This might get a little technical, so keep sipping that coffee!

#### 1\. Codec

Every video has a codec and a container associated with it. A video codec is an order in which the video data is organized for playback, editing, and other functions. There are lots of different types of codecs, and each of them has different functions and advantages.

#### 2\. Container

A container is responsible for holding video data and other information in a single file. Containers have file extensions like .mp4, .avi, .mov, etc. Some containers can only hold videos in one specific codec, while others can hold multiple codecs. Containers are also responsible for telling media players whether a video has audio or not.

Why are codecs and containers so important? Imagine if you watched a 1080p video (codec) on an old TV (container) – it would work, but would you really be interested in seeing it? Probably not. A mismatch between containers and codecs can result in poor quality, which is why you must shoot your videos in the right format and play them on the right platform.

#### 3\. Video compression and re-encoding

You might be wondering at what point of the whole process does the video loses quality. When you capture the video, it is of the highest quality. As soon as you compress it to share it online, some quality loss occurs, even if you convert it into a high-quality video.

When you export a video that’s already been exported, you re-encode the video. **Re-encoding a VLC video can result in even more quality loss.**

The truth is, you can’t reduce the video size without losing quality no matter what you do. If you’re editing a video shot in 4K, but you export it in 720p, the video will become compressed, and the original data of the video won’t get transferred to the new video, resulting in a pixelated block of mess.

When you make changes to a video with a **video trimmer app**, you’re changing the data structure that holds information about the video. Why do VLC videos that are small in size appear pixelated and blurry? It’s because they don’t have as much information as videos with larger sizes.

The truth is, you can’t reduce the video size without losing quality no matter what you do.

When you make changes to a video with a **video trimmer app**, you’re changing the data structure that holds information about the video. Why do VLC videos that are small in size appear pixelated and blurry? It’s because they don’t have as much information as videos with larger sizes.

_Is there a way to trim VLC without losing quality?_ Of course! Trimming VLC videos without losing quality can be a bit frustrating sometimes. Fortunately, there are applications available that can help you edit videos without losing quality. Wondershare Filmora is one such software that can be downloaded for free. You cannot miss it.

In this article, we will introduce why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality, then recommend 3 video editors trim high-quality video without lowering the quality.

* [Section 1\. Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality](#why-trim-vlc-loss-quality)
* [Section 2\. Video editor to trim VLC videos without loss of quality](#software-trim-vlc-without-loss-quality)

## Section 1.  Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality?

To understand quality loss, you first need to understand codecs, containers, and video re-encoding. This might get a little technical, so keep sipping that coffee!

#### 1\. Codec

Every video has a codec and a container associated with it. A video codec is an order in which the video data is organized for playback, editing, and other functions. There are lots of different types of codecs, and each of them has different functions and advantages.

#### 2\. Container

A container is responsible for holding video data and other information in a single file. Containers have file extensions like .mp4, .avi, .mov, etc. Some containers can only hold videos in one specific codec, while others can hold multiple codecs. Containers are also responsible for telling media players whether a video has audio or not.

Why are codecs and containers so important? Imagine if you watched a 1080p video (codec) on an old TV (container) – it would work, but would you really be interested in seeing it? Probably not. A mismatch between containers and codecs can result in poor quality, which is why you must shoot your videos in the right format and play them on the right platform.

#### 3\. Video compression and re-encoding

You might be wondering at what point of the whole process does the video loses quality. When you capture the video, it is of the highest quality. As soon as you compress it to share it online, some quality loss occurs, even if you convert it into a high-quality video.

When you export a video that’s already been exported, you re-encode the video. **Re-encoding a VLC video can result in even more quality loss.**

The truth is, you can’t reduce the video size without losing quality no matter what you do. If you’re editing a video shot in 4K, but you export it in 720p, the video will become compressed, and the original data of the video won’t get transferred to the new video, resulting in a pixelated block of mess.

When you make changes to a video with a **video trimmer app**, you’re changing the data structure that holds information about the video. Why do VLC videos that are small in size appear pixelated and blurry? It’s because they don’t have as much information as videos with larger sizes.

## Part 2: Best Android Game Download Sites to Download Free Android Games

Android is growing very fast; now, almost everyone uses it and prefers it over any other software. Here are the best websites from where you can download free android apps:

#### 1 [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store)

Google Play is the most common website to download free android apps. It is free, it is fast, and it is efficient. You can not only use this from your android mobile but also operate it and download apps using your laptop.

**Key Features:**

* The apps are easily downloaded, depending upon your internet connection.
* The purchase methods are through credit cards, and the procedure is straightforward.
* The platform allows everyone and anyone to sell their games.
* Sign up through your Google account is necessary to access these features.

**Pros:**

* It is easily accessible.
* It is pre-installed on all android supported devices.
* It contains a massive collection of unique apps, from books to music, workout, and games of various types.

**Cons:**

* Since everyone and anyone can access it without paying any registration fee, it is exposed to scams and harassment.
* A few games do not function and keep crashing.

#### 2 [Android Games Room](http://www.androidgamesroom.com/)

![android games room](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/android-games-room.jpg)

It contains thousands of free gaming apps in different categories like action, arcade, adventure, simulation, song games, and puzzle games. The download links are readily available; you can even access this site from your mobile by scanning a QR code. This site is a pretty good platform to download free games but has certain flaws. It does not allow a multiplayer gaming experience, and no customer services are provided.

#### 3 [Android Apps](https://androidapps.com/)

![android apps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/android-apps.jpg)

It is another platform to download android apps for free. This site is pretty good since it updates games that developers handpick almost daily. You can also promote your app using the ‘promote your app’ feature. The site has a lot of updates and takes an unreasonable amount of time to install and update the software. Furthermore, you can say that they do not have a customer service function because nobody ever responds to the customer’s queries.

#### 4 [1 Mobile](http://www.1mobile.com/)

![1 mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-mobile.jpg)

One mobile is a free android store. It provides its users the easiest way to locate, download and manage free apps. 1 Mobile has over eighty (80) million apps. One mobile has just been recently updated, has a brand new interface design, and operates much smoother. The content is more prosperous, smoother, and a thousand times better than before the latest update. All the apps and games are 100% free forever without hidden charges. It supports various languages like English, Korean, Chinese, French, Spanish, Japanese, and Portugal.

#### 5 [Approx](http://ww1.approb.com/)

![approb](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/approb.jpg)

It provides the best free apps not only for android but OS as well. You can download it on your phone by scanning a QR code. This software has been functioning for the past six years and is free from viruses or malware.
