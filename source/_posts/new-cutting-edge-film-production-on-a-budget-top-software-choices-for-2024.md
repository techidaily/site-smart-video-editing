* [**Part 1: Film Editing Software to Edit Videos**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: Filmmaking Software to Improve Workflow**](#part2)

## 6 Filmmaking Software You Need to Know

## Part 1: Film Editing Software to Edit Videos

### 1. [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora - a video editor which has significantly improved overall performance, making the product faster, and more powerful, and taking the user editing experience to a new level.

It is perfect for helping beginners, and intermediate users create stylish videos by providing an intuitive user interface and built-in effects.

### 2. [Vegas Pro](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/)

Vegas Pro is one of the most well-known budget options out there when it comes to video editing. It actually started out as editing software for audio (podcasts, radio shows, etc.), but then expanded over time. Because of those beginnings, many people have found that it is one of the best options you’ll have available when it comes to audio editing within a film. It’s also very versatile – you don’t need anything but a Windows PC in order to run it.

![Vegas Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magix-vegas-pro.jpg)

## Part 2: Filmmaking Software to Improve Workflow

### 2. [StudioBinder](https://www.studiobinder.com/script-sides/)

Keeping up with the production process takes a lot of work, and Studio Binder was specially designed to help you take care of those things more easily. From script breakdowns (which keep everyone in the loop as to what is next in filming) to lists where you keep track of what shots you’ve taken and which you need to take, it has everything you need to keep your entire team on track throughout the entire process of filming.

![StudioBinder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/StudioBinder.jpg)

### 3. [Storyboarder](https://wonderunit.com/storyboarder/)

Keeping up with the story and everything around it during the filming process can take a lot of work. That’s why many filmmakers suggest putting together what is known as a storyboard – a rough draft of the storyline, put together in a fashion so that you can follow everything and check it all out properly. Storyboarder is a software package that helps you to visualize everything, check out if the story works, and keep up with your ideas (even if you get distracted during filming).

![Storyboarder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Storyboarder.jpg)

### 4. [Adobe Audition](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html)

Sometimes, you need something that is a little more advanced and focused when it comes to putting together the sound mix in a way that is pleasing to the ears. Adobe Audition is one of the most popular options for this, because it has all of the tools necessary so that you can get the perfect balance and fullness of sound in your film. Your sound is just as important as your videography, so picking this up can be really helpful in the long run.

![Adobe Audition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audition.jpg)

### 5. [Evernote](https://evernote.com/)

Organization is absolutely essential when you’re trying to put a film together and, because of that, you’re likely exploring a lot of different options that can help you to stay organized. Evernote is a lovely option and it’s available for computers and for phones/tablets, so you can take it anywhere with you. You can put together task lists, keep notes on what’s going on during the filming process, and more. It’s a really simple program to use and it’s quite easy to import and export info from it.

![Evernote](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Evernote.jpg)

### 6. [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/)

Google Docs is part of the Google Suite, and it’s a smart word processing program that has all of the flexibility of programs like Microsoft Word. One of the biggest differences, however, is the ability to collaborate and work on the same document without the need to send it back and forth via email. Changes are updated in real time, so you can work on a document together, even if you aren’t in the same vicinity.

![Google Docs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Google-Docs.jpg)

## Conclusion

Do some research on the web and find the options that work best for your team’s budget and for how you plan on working on your films. You can find plenty of low-budget software that can help to make your film look great without breaking the budget you’ve set into place.

Today, we all use cameras and cell phones to capture many important events in our lives. Sometimes the recorded videos are shaky due to various factors such as a sudden hand movement, a lack of stabilization in our recording equipment, and so on.

Users can utilize video stabilizer applications to solve this issue. Using these applications, users may quickly smooth out shaky areas of a video on their Android smartphones. However, finding an excellent **Android Video Stabilizer** is still a hard task due to the number of applications present in the market. But don't worry, a few of the best video stabilizers are reviewed in this article. Let's get going!

#### In this article

01 [What Is the Difference Between OIS and EIS?](#part1)

02 [Best Free Video Stabilizer Apps for Android](#part2)

## Part 1: What Is the Difference Between OIS and EIS?

The majority of individuals favor OIS over EIS. A hardware approach is always preferable to a software platform since EIS is essentially a repair solution that causes picture resolution deterioration by cutting it and estimating what this would seem like if it were steady. OIS also performs better in low-light conditions. The best video stabilizer app for android is the one that incorporates both approaches.

Moreover, OIS and EIS both hold a significant reputation for video stabilization. And not much, but some people prefer Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) to stabilize their video as it converts the optical signal to a digital one. You will get a better understanding of both the stabilization technologies after reading what's written below:

**Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS)**

Electronic image stabilization operates on a fundamentally different premise, with the problem being tackled at the coding layer after the visible light has been transformed to a digital signal.

**Optical Image Stabilization (OIS)**

The picture is stabilized with this approach by altering the optical path of the detector. Because this is real-time correction, no image change or degradation occurs. The lens component is rotated such that it is parallel to the picture plane.

## Part 2: Best Free Video Stabilizer Apps for Android

## Part 1: What Is the Difference Between OIS and EIS?

The majority of individuals favor OIS over EIS. A hardware approach is always preferable to a software platform since EIS is essentially a repair solution that causes picture resolution deterioration by cutting it and estimating what this would seem like if it were steady. OIS also performs better in low-light conditions. The best video stabilizer app for android is the one that incorporates both approaches.

## Part 4: How to Share and [Download Your WhatsApp Status Video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)?

WhatsApp debuted the 'Status' feature a few years ago. Many people use both Instagram and WhatsApp to update their status. It happens that, at times, you might want to save your friends' statuses as a remembrance or for some other reason. While photos can be screenshotted, videos require the help of the File Manager or any third-party app.

Below are the steps you need to follow for saving WhatsApp status and then sharing it further.

**Method 1: Save It with File Manager**

Step 1: View the status that you wish to save. This creates a temporary copy on the phone's storage.

Step 2: Open your **File Manager app**. Click on the hamburger icon (three dots) present on the right corner of the screen.

![file manager app show hidden files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/file-manager-app-show-hidden-files.jpg)

 Step 3: On the next screen of Settings, you can enable the option of show hidden files. Go to the internal storage of the device.

![file manager whatsapp files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/file-manager-whatsapp-files.jpg)

 Step 4: Look for the WhatsApp folder, go to ‘Media’ and then click on the folder ‘.Statuses’

![file manager whatsapp statuses](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/file-manager-whatsapp-statuses.jpg)

Step 5: From here you can copy any file and then save it to another folder to watch or share later on.

**Method 2: Save It with Third-Party App**

Step 1: First, download the app ['Status Saver – Downloader for WhatsApp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.downlood.sav.whmedia&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US).' And open the app and grant it storage access.

Step 2: In order to save someone's WhatsApp status, you must first view it in WhatsApp. After watching the status, open the Status Saver app.

Step 3: When you open it, you will see all the statuses you have seen on WhatsApp. Tap on the movie or image you wish to save, then click the download icon at the bottom. The share icon on the right allows you to share the status with WhatsApp contacts, Instagram, Facebook, and other networks.

## Part 5: FAQs about WhatsApp Status

**Who can see my WhatsApp status?**

It's only possible for someone to see your status updates if both of you have each other's phone numbers in your phone's address book. You have the option of sharing your status updates with everyone in your contact list or just those you specify. Unless you change this setting, your status updates are visible to everyone on your contact list.

**What is the benefit of using WhatsApp status?**

The WhatsApp status feature allows the user to share pictures, text, videos, and GIFs on their account. The best part is that these disappear after 24 hours and are end-to-end encrypted. This feature makes it possible for you to stay in touch with people by sharing motivation posts, fun videos, or any memorable moment.

**How to Know Who Viewed My WhatsApp Status?**

It is very easy to check who has viewed your WhatsApp status. The steps you need to follow are:

1. Open WhatsApp and tap the Status tab;
2. Then click on 'My Status,' and a list of statuses will appear.
3. Tap on the status that you want to check viewers for, and then look for the 'eye' icon.Click the 'eye' icon, and a list of viewers will appear.
