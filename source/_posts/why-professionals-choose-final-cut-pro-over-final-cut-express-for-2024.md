## Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?

Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.

Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.

It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.

## Part 2: Is Final Cut Express Still Available?

No, concurrent with the launch of Final Cut Pro X on June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued and removed from the Apple online store.

You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.

Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.

As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!

Boring and unexciting videos may turn off your mode. You need something special or wonderful that could turn you on and make your memories worth watching.

To let users give a new look to their pictures and videos, Apple Inc. released its first video editing software Final Cut Express in 2003\. Over the next few years, various improvements were made in its updated versions.

![Final-Cut-Express](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Final-Cut-Express.png)

However, after multiple inconveniences, Apple Inc. discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 and launched its new version Final Cut Pro with advanced video editing features. Final Cut Pro was customized for video editing professionals with advanced knowledge of video editing. It is available for just $299.99 with 90 days free trial.

Some alternatives to Final Cut Express are also available in the market such as Final Cut Pro of crouse, iMovie, a low-end alternative, and Filmora, popular among beginners and pros. Let’s look at these tools individually in this article.

## Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?

Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.

Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.

It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.

## Part 2: Is Final Cut Express Still Available?

No, concurrent with the launch of Final Cut Pro X on June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued and removed from the Apple online store.

You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.

Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.

As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!

## **Part 5: Best Alternative to Final Cut Express**

Now, as Final Cut Express is no longer available, you may want to try the other two editors of Apple. While iMovie mainly targeted beginners, Final Cut Express and Pro targeted users with moderate to advanced knowledge of video editing.

For those beginners who wanted to make professional-looking videos without any editing skills, Wondershare launched Filmora as an alternative to Final Cut Express and Pro.

This user-friendly made video editing as simple as ABC. From offering multiple hand-picked effects to advanced editing options, Filmora allows you to range markers, perfect your audio, group timeline clips, and perform detailed color correction with auto-correction and color wheels for free.

**Key Features**

* Advanced video editing options;
* 300+ free handcrafted effects
* User-friendly video editing tools; and
* Video conversion options to multiple formats.

## Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?

Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.

Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.

It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.

## Part 2: Is Final Cut Express Still Available?

No, concurrent with the launch of Final Cut Pro X on June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued and removed from the Apple online store.

You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.

Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.

As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!

Boring and unexciting videos may turn off your mode. You need something special or wonderful that could turn you on and make your memories worth watching.

To let users give a new look to their pictures and videos, Apple Inc. released its first video editing software Final Cut Express in 2003\. Over the next few years, various improvements were made in its updated versions.

![Final-Cut-Express](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Final-Cut-Express.png)

However, after multiple inconveniences, Apple Inc. discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 and launched its new version Final Cut Pro with advanced video editing features. Final Cut Pro was customized for video editing professionals with advanced knowledge of video editing. It is available for just $299.99 with 90 days free trial.

Some alternatives to Final Cut Express are also available in the market such as Final Cut Pro of crouse, iMovie, a low-end alternative, and Filmora, popular among beginners and pros. Let’s look at these tools individually in this article.

## Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?

Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.

Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.

It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.

## Part 2: Is Final Cut Express Still Available?

No, concurrent with the launch of Final Cut Pro X on June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued and removed from the Apple online store.

You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.

Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.

As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!

## Part 2: Why Final Cut Pro trial won't open?

 Although there shouldn't be any issue in downloading the Final Cut Pro trial version, if you meet your system's requirements, some customers are complaining that they can't download or install the Final Cur Pro trial package. Well, if that's happening, there could be a few reasons which are highlighted below.

![fcpx-in-mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/fcpx-in-mac.jpg)

**Poor Internet Connection**

The most common reason for not being able to download Final Cut Pro 90 days trial version is you have a poor internet connection. You may feel that you have a superb browsing speed, but if your downloading speed is slow, the file may encounter some glitches, eventually ending up with a broken Final Cut Pro Trial file. And once the package is broken, you won't be able to install the installer package. Also, the downloading file is quite huge, and you need to have a proper internet connection. So, before contacting Apple to check whether your internet connection is strong or not.

**Check System Requirements**

To download the Final Cut Pro free trial version, your Mac system has to meet Apple's minimum requirements. Even if one of the requirements fails to meet, you won't be able to download Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial. To try the latest version, the OS has to be 10.15.6 or later. Your system must have 4GB of RAM and a metal-capable graphics card. The disk space should be 3.8GB. Ensure that your system meets the requirement. If the OS is not updated, update it before trying to download the package.

**Try Using Another Account**

Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial is essentially available for new users or those already using the 30days free trial. For those who are already on the 30-days free trial, the free trial package will automatically get extended. But Final Cut Pro already has your account details. Hence, if your previous free trial expired already, you may face some issues when trying to download, launch, or run the latest 90-days free trial offer. So, you can use another account and sign up and then try to download the newest version.

**Quit and Restart your System**

If you have successfully downloaded and installed Final Cut Pro but are unable to launch Final Cut Pro even after refreshing memory, probably, there is a minor glitch on your system. The primary thing to do would be trying to restart your system and then check if you are able to launch it now.

**Disconnect External Devices**

If you are using a malfunctioning or incompatible external device, even then, you may face problems while running Final Cut Pro. To resolve this issue, first shut down your system. Now, apart from the mouse and keyboard, disconnect every other external device that you are using. Next, reset NVRAM and now try to launch Final Cut Pro; it should operate normally now.

## Part 3: How to reset the Final Cut Pro trial before it expires?

 Final Cut Pro free trial version will be over after 90 days because that's their policy. Unfortunately, this means that once the free trial version is over, you will have to buy Final Cut Pro to continue using it. However, there is a way to reset it. But first, you need to check if your Mac has swift library installed. If it is installed and running, go on and enter the code mentioned below in the terminal and then hit enter. After everything is done, the code will be executed, and the rest of the free trial version will be completed.

 ![trial-expire](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/trial-expire.jpg)

Code to reset Final Cut Pro 10.4.4

 #!/usr/bin/swift

 import Foundation

 let path = URL(fileURLWithPath: NSString(string: "\~/Library/Application Support/.ffuserdata").expandingTildeInPath)

 let data = try! NSData(contentsOf: path) as Data

 let dictionary = try! NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveTopLevelObjectWithData(data) as! NSDictionary

 let mutableDictionary = dictionary.mutableCopy() as! NSMutableDictionary

 for (key, value) in mutableDictionary {

 if value is NSDate {

 mutableDictionary\[key\] = Date()

 }

 }

 try! NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: mutableDictionary, requiringSecureCoding: false).write(to: path)

 print("You'd better buy it")

 It's quite complicated that you will have to enter this code manually into the terminal each time the trial expires. Regrettably, there is no way to extend the free trial permanently, so you will have to repeat this part over and over again.

But to be aware, this may lead to a ban or other punishment to your account by Apple Inc.

Anyway, it makes sense why people want to stick to their free trial! Final Cut Pro is not an affordable video editing tool.

If you love fcpx that much but can't afford it, [see how to get fcpx with the cheapest price here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Or, you can try other powerful editors with much lower prices, like Filmora.

## Part 4: FAQ

**What is the limitation of the trial version of FCPX?**

Final Cut Pro Additional Content, which includes over 1300 royalty-free sound effects for use in your projects, isn’t available in the Final Cut Pro trial. The trial is fully functional otherwise.

You can import media, edit, organize, add effects, color correct, export files in a variety of professional formats, and more. Get an overview of Final Cut Pro.

**Is Final Cut Pro worth the price?**

Final Cut Pro comes with robust video editing features, which can help you create stunning and professional-level videos. However, Final Cut Pro is not for beginners, and if $299 is a little too expensive for you, it is better to find another video editing tool that won't cost you this much and will let you create professional-looking videos effortlessly. This is when Filmora by Wondershare comes into play.

And for those who are trying out Final Cut Pro, here is a collection of [FCPX tutorials](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for you to get started with!

## Part 2: Why Final Cut Pro trial won't open?

 Although there shouldn't be any issue in downloading the Final Cut Pro trial version, if you meet your system's requirements, some customers are complaining that they can't download or install the Final Cur Pro trial package. Well, if that's happening, there could be a few reasons which are highlighted below.

![fcpx-in-mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/fcpx-in-mac.jpg)

**Poor Internet Connection**

The most common reason for not being able to download Final Cut Pro 90 days trial version is you have a poor internet connection. You may feel that you have a superb browsing speed, but if your downloading speed is slow, the file may encounter some glitches, eventually ending up with a broken Final Cut Pro Trial file. And once the package is broken, you won't be able to install the installer package. Also, the downloading file is quite huge, and you need to have a proper internet connection. So, before contacting Apple to check whether your internet connection is strong or not.

**Check System Requirements**

To download the Final Cut Pro free trial version, your Mac system has to meet Apple's minimum requirements. Even if one of the requirements fails to meet, you won't be able to download Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial. To try the latest version, the OS has to be 10.15.6 or later. Your system must have 4GB of RAM and a metal-capable graphics card. The disk space should be 3.8GB. Ensure that your system meets the requirement. If the OS is not updated, update it before trying to download the package.

**Try Using Another Account**

Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial is essentially available for new users or those already using the 30days free trial. For those who are already on the 30-days free trial, the free trial package will automatically get extended. But Final Cut Pro already has your account details. Hence, if your previous free trial expired already, you may face some issues when trying to download, launch, or run the latest 90-days free trial offer. So, you can use another account and sign up and then try to download the newest version.

**Quit and Restart your System**

If you have successfully downloaded and installed Final Cut Pro but are unable to launch Final Cut Pro even after refreshing memory, probably, there is a minor glitch on your system. The primary thing to do would be trying to restart your system and then check if you are able to launch it now.

**Disconnect External Devices**

If you are using a malfunctioning or incompatible external device, even then, you may face problems while running Final Cut Pro. To resolve this issue, first shut down your system. Now, apart from the mouse and keyboard, disconnect every other external device that you are using. Next, reset NVRAM and now try to launch Final Cut Pro; it should operate normally now.

## Part 3: How to reset the Final Cut Pro trial before it expires?

 Final Cut Pro free trial version will be over after 90 days because that's their policy. Unfortunately, this means that once the free trial version is over, you will have to buy Final Cut Pro to continue using it. However, there is a way to reset it. But first, you need to check if your Mac has swift library installed. If it is installed and running, go on and enter the code mentioned below in the terminal and then hit enter. After everything is done, the code will be executed, and the rest of the free trial version will be completed.

 ![trial-expire](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/trial-expire.jpg)

Code to reset Final Cut Pro 10.4.4

 #!/usr/bin/swift

 import Foundation

 let path = URL(fileURLWithPath: NSString(string: "\~/Library/Application Support/.ffuserdata").expandingTildeInPath)

 let data = try! NSData(contentsOf: path) as Data

 let dictionary = try! NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveTopLevelObjectWithData(data) as! NSDictionary

 let mutableDictionary = dictionary.mutableCopy() as! NSMutableDictionary

 for (key, value) in mutableDictionary {

 if value is NSDate {

 mutableDictionary\[key\] = Date()

 }

 }

 try! NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: mutableDictionary, requiringSecureCoding: false).write(to: path)

 print("You'd better buy it")

 It's quite complicated that you will have to enter this code manually into the terminal each time the trial expires. Regrettably, there is no way to extend the free trial permanently, so you will have to repeat this part over and over again.

But to be aware, this may lead to a ban or other punishment to your account by Apple Inc.

Anyway, it makes sense why people want to stick to their free trial! Final Cut Pro is not an affordable video editing tool.

If you love fcpx that much but can't afford it, [see how to get fcpx with the cheapest price here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Or, you can try other powerful editors with much lower prices, like Filmora.

## Part 4: FAQ

**What is the limitation of the trial version of FCPX?**

Final Cut Pro Additional Content, which includes over 1300 royalty-free sound effects for use in your projects, isn’t available in the Final Cut Pro trial. The trial is fully functional otherwise.

You can import media, edit, organize, add effects, color correct, export files in a variety of professional formats, and more. Get an overview of Final Cut Pro.

**Is Final Cut Pro worth the price?**

Final Cut Pro comes with robust video editing features, which can help you create stunning and professional-level videos. However, Final Cut Pro is not for beginners, and if $299 is a little too expensive for you, it is better to find another video editing tool that won't cost you this much and will let you create professional-looking videos effortlessly. This is when Filmora by Wondershare comes into play.

## Part 4: Top 5 Warp Stabilizer Tips and Troubleshooting

 **Premiere Pro stabilize** is a powerful tool, but it also carries some limitations. Let's check them out!

**1\. Consider warp stabilize during shooting:**

If you keep in mind the warp stabilizer function while filming your videos or photos, you'll get rid of fixing problems after the work. So, if you want glossy touch in your shots with zero access to a gimbal, you should consider filming with a faster shutter speed or a wider frame. In this way, you'll get more convenience while applying the effect in the edit.

**2\. Modify extra cropping in your footage:**

Warp stabilizer is a tool that can provide you stable footage and crop your shot as well. It can crop out the edges of your photos or videos, giving you a smooth and clean shot. To adjust the cropping in your clips, go to advanced settings and then click on Crop less <-> Smooth More Slider.

**3\. Analyze the effect of Warp stabilizer:**

Always check the order of effects in the ''Effect Controls'' folder. If you ever lost some stabilization after editing your shot, ensure not to change the Warp Stabilizer analysis source. Further, you should always re-analyze your clip after a quick color fix.

**4\. Nest your clips:**

Sometimes we got an error message in the form of a red banner across our footage while trying to modify the speed on **premiere stabilize video**. Basically, we can't use a Warp stabilizer to alter the speed of the same clip. But no worries! There is an easy fix – click on the altered clip and then click on Nest. Now, you can fix the nested sequence without any trouble.

**5\. Save your favorite settings as a preset:**

If you've found a setting that gives you a happy result, you can save it as a preset for future use. In this way, you can speed up your work nicely while working with numerous shaky clips. Also, it can help if you want to make a similar effect to your multiple projects. Moreover, keep in mind that the Warp stabilizer needs to assess each clip frame by frame because it is not a one-size model that can fit all footage. Therefore, remember to click the ''Analyze'' button even after putting the preset to turn it on.

## Part 5: How to Stabilize Shaky Footage Without Using Warp Stabilizer?

Sometimes, the shakiness of clips is too extreme, and the Warp Stabilizer effect can't handle it. Moreover, the filter algorithm incorrectly compensates for the camera moves. So what strategy should apply in this condition? Luckily, there is a method that can be used to stabilize your clips without using a warp stabilizer. Moreover, this process can give a hyper-realistic effect to your footage!

**Step1:** Import your clip into Premiere Pro Project and add it to your timeline. Hit on the "clip", choose "Replace with After Effects Composition" to import the clip.

**Step 2:** Tap on the ''Tracker panel'' from the right side of the screen. Scroll down to the ''Track Motion'' option and open it.

**Step 3:** Pick the tracker marker, drag it to an area of contrasting subject and adjust it accordingly.

![adobe premiere pro track motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-pro-track-motion.jpg)

Tip: Remember not to make the outer box too large as After Effects can have a hard time performing the track.

**Step 4:** Hit the play button in the ''Tracker panel'' to initiate the After Effects. Create a new ''Null Object'' after the tracking process is complete.

**Step 5:** Move to the Tracker panel, click on "Edit Target," choose your "Null Object" and click "OK."

**Step 6:** Create a new camera and parent it to the null object for applying the stabilization effect to your clips. Enable the 3D option on both the footage layer and the null object.

**Step 7:** Extend your footage to compensate for any black bars that can occur as the camera pays for the shakiness. That's it!

**Conclusion:**

Shaky footage is almost inescapable once you go handheld. If you don't have a manual stabilizer like a gimbal, a tripod, or a glide cam – your work can fall victim to running, wind, walking, or other elements. In this article, we've introduced a quick and fast antidote for shaky footage – a Warp Stabilizer effect in the Adobe Premiere Pro. It can smooth out your shaky photos or videos with just a few clicks. So, do you know how to **stabilize video premiere pro**? Read out the article!

## Part 4: Top 5 Warp Stabilizer Tips and Troubleshooting

 **Premiere Pro stabilize** is a powerful tool, but it also carries some limitations. Let's check them out!

**1\. Consider warp stabilize during shooting:**

If you keep in mind the warp stabilizer function while filming your videos or photos, you'll get rid of fixing problems after the work. So, if you want glossy touch in your shots with zero access to a gimbal, you should consider filming with a faster shutter speed or a wider frame. In this way, you'll get more convenience while applying the effect in the edit.

**2\. Modify extra cropping in your footage:**

Warp stabilizer is a tool that can provide you stable footage and crop your shot as well. It can crop out the edges of your photos or videos, giving you a smooth and clean shot. To adjust the cropping in your clips, go to advanced settings and then click on Crop less <-> Smooth More Slider.

**3\. Analyze the effect of Warp stabilizer:**

Always check the order of effects in the ''Effect Controls'' folder. If you ever lost some stabilization after editing your shot, ensure not to change the Warp Stabilizer analysis source. Further, you should always re-analyze your clip after a quick color fix.

**4\. Nest your clips:**

Sometimes we got an error message in the form of a red banner across our footage while trying to modify the speed on **premiere stabilize video**. Basically, we can't use a Warp stabilizer to alter the speed of the same clip. But no worries! There is an easy fix – click on the altered clip and then click on Nest. Now, you can fix the nested sequence without any trouble.

**5\. Save your favorite settings as a preset:**

If you've found a setting that gives you a happy result, you can save it as a preset for future use. In this way, you can speed up your work nicely while working with numerous shaky clips. Also, it can help if you want to make a similar effect to your multiple projects. Moreover, keep in mind that the Warp stabilizer needs to assess each clip frame by frame because it is not a one-size model that can fit all footage. Therefore, remember to click the ''Analyze'' button even after putting the preset to turn it on.

## Part 5: How to Stabilize Shaky Footage Without Using Warp Stabilizer?

Sometimes, the shakiness of clips is too extreme, and the Warp Stabilizer effect can't handle it. Moreover, the filter algorithm incorrectly compensates for the camera moves. So what strategy should apply in this condition? Luckily, there is a method that can be used to stabilize your clips without using a warp stabilizer. Moreover, this process can give a hyper-realistic effect to your footage!

**Step1:** Import your clip into Premiere Pro Project and add it to your timeline. Hit on the "clip", choose "Replace with After Effects Composition" to import the clip.

**Step 2:** Tap on the ''Tracker panel'' from the right side of the screen. Scroll down to the ''Track Motion'' option and open it.

![adobe premiere pro track motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-pro-track-motion.jpg)

Tip: Remember not to make the outer box too large as After Effects can have a hard time performing the track.

**Step 4:** Hit the play button in the ''Tracker panel'' to initiate the After Effects. Create a new ''Null Object'' after the tracking process is complete.

**Step 5:** Move to the Tracker panel, click on "Edit Target," choose your "Null Object" and click "OK."

**Step 6:** Create a new camera and parent it to the null object for applying the stabilization effect to your clips. Enable the 3D option on both the footage layer and the null object.

**Step 7:** Extend your footage to compensate for any black bars that can occur as the camera pays for the shakiness. That's it!
