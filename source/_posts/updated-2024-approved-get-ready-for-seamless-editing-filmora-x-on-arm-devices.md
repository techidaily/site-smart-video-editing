It's official! Apple will now start making in-house processors for Macs based on ARM 64-bit architecture, proving to be faster and much more efficient than its previous models. With all that, there might be a problem. Any software that does not support the new Apple M1 chip may not be compatible with Apple devices. But Wondershare has taken care of that small inconvenience.

![apple m1 chip in arm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/apple-m1-chip-in-arm.jpg)

The good news is that all versions of Wondershare Filmora X that are above 10.1 will support ARM. We at Wondershare have conducted these internal tests on all Apple Mac devices such as the Macbook Air, Macbook Mini, and Macbook Pro.

The testers at Wondershare have found out that our state-of-the-art software is all set to be utilized on the new and improved M1 chip that will be used in the new Macbooks.

We have released our newest version of Filmora which is the 10.1 and that is just the beginning! We plan to upgrade our software and come out with innovations that will surely match every update that Apple comes up with using the latest ARM 64-bit architecture.

As Apple introduces technological innovations, Filmora will match that with its product and service upgrades to ensure a better video editing experience for its users.

![video1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/video1.jpg)

(VideoLAN Movie Creator or VLMC is the free video editing program, giving features to get semi-professional quality films, however with an aim to stay user-friendly and simple. Developers of the most famous video players in world, the VLC Media Player, now have started the new and promising project: called Videolan Movie Creator. It is "promising" because the Videolan Movie Creator still is at the early stage of the development. From the developers, it is just the pre-alpha release, and with many important features missing & plenty of bugs. However, they are taking a close look on it that nobody could resist this temptation! Testing Videolan Movie Creator is an adventure. Program still is unstable & buggy, thus expect some crashes.

![pitivi](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/pitivi1.jpg)

PiTiVi is the open source editor, written in the Python and based at GStreamer & GTK+.

PiTiVi may encode and capture video and audio, trim and split video clips, enhance and trim audio & render projects at any format that is supported by GStreamer framework. The PiTiVi was been added by kn (the Contributor) at 17/04/2009 and latest change was made

#### 10\. [Cinelerra – Best Free Video Editing Software In Market](https://cinelerra.org/)

![cine](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cine1.jpg)

Cinelerra is the highly professional and advanced video editing program, however still remains the open source. Cinelerra will solve 3 important tasks: capturing, compositing and editing. There is no limit to video resolution thus whether it is standard or HD does not really matter at Cinelerra. Cinelerra always has been free and may remain so since developers are working very closely with traditional technical design & manufacturing companies and media and broadcast production companies all along with the Independent Artists & Technologists to bring some new capabilities and higher functionality. We know that Cinelerra isn't perfect, however, it's one platform that we can build on together to make our independent and professional studios.
