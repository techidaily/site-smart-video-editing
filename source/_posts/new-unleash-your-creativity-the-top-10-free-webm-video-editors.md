The raw footage you record with your Smartphone or digital camera is not going to be saved in WebM file format.

Finding a [video editing app you can use for free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and that supports this video file format can be a daunting task. That is why we combed through the Internet in search of the **best free WebM video editors** you can use online or on your desktop computer. Here’s what we’ve come up with.

Editing videos on the Internet has its challenges, as most online video editors offer only a limited set of video editing tools. Even so, the video editing software products we featured in this article provide you with all the video editing options you are going to need to polish your WebM videos before posting them on social media or uploading them to your website. Let’s take a look at some of the best **online WebM video editors**.

## Part 1: 5 Best Online WebM Video Editors

The complexity of the video editing tasks you want to perform is the best way to determine which online WebM video editor you should use. So, if you would like to create WebM videos in a particular style then you should choose an [online video editing app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that allows you to do much more than just trimming or resizing a video clip. Here are the five best online WebM video editors you can use for free.

#### 1\. [ClipChamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/video-editor)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $9.00 per month

Before you can start editing a WebM video with Clipchamp, you must first set up an account. This online video editor already has more than 7 million registered users, which speaks volumes about its capabilities. You can choose from a broad range of fully customizable video templates that are optimized for use on different social networks and save you time on performing the video editing tasks on your own.

Clipchamp features impressive stock audio and video libraries you can use to create soundtracks or as a source of complementary footage for your WebM videos. The free version of this online video editor only lets you export videos in 480p resolution and you cannot use the stock footage for free.

#### 2\. [WeVideo](https://www.wevideo.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $4.99 per month

This video editing platform offers a broad range of video editing options, so you will have very little trouble turning your footage saved in WebM format into attention-grabbing videos. The video editing tools you will have at your disposal depending on the subscription model you purchase.

With the Free version of WeVideo, you will only have five minutes of publishing time, you won’t be able to export WebM videos in resolutions larger than 480p and each video you create is going to be watermarked. That is why you must opt for Power, Unlimited, Professional or Business subscription package if you want your WebM videos to really stand out on social media.

#### 3\. [Magisto](https://www.magisto.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $4.99

Video content creators who post their videos on Instagram, Facebook or YouTube are going to love using Magisto. This web-based video editor is powered by AI that does all the video editing for you, which enables you to simply import the WebM videos you want to edit, select a video editing style and enjoy the results. In addition, you can choose from hundreds of customizable templates that can be used to promote a business or to create a Valentine’s Day video.

The duration of the videos you can create with Magisto depends on the subscription model you have, but even if you choose the most expensive version of Magisto you are still not going to be able to export videos that are longer than 10 minutes.

#### 4\. [Online UniConverter](https://www.media.io/video-editor.html)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $2.95 per month

Online UniConverter can be used to convert, compress or edit audio and video files for free, although your options are going to be limited if you opt for the free version of the web-based application. The free Video Editor enables you to perform basic video editing actions like trimming, cropping or rotating videos. In addition, you can adjust the Hue, Saturation or Brightness values of all WebM files you edit with Online UniConverter.

None of the videos you edit with this web-based video editor are going to be watermarked, but exporting videos in resolutions larger than 1080p isn’t an option.

#### 5\. [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/video/)

**Price:** Free

Even though this is primarily a file conversion platform that enables you to change the format of images, PDF, audio or video files, you can also use Aconvert to edit your WebM videos. You can’t do much more other than cut, crop, rotate or merge video clips. In addition, you cannot upload video clips that are larger than 200MB to this platform which can make the video editing process difficult, since WebM videos can easily exceed this size limit.

Aconvert is far from being a perfect WebM video editor, but it still offers enough video editing options to enable you to create videos you can share online.

## Part 2: 5 Best Free Desktop WebM Video Editors

Desktop-based video editing software products are commonly much more powerful than those that can only be used online, which makes **editing WebM videos** somewhat easier. Here are some of the best desktop WebM video editors you can use for free on Mac or PC computers.

#### 1\. [VSDC](http://www.videosoftdev.com/free-video-editor)

**Compatibility:** Windows XP or later

Editing WebM videos with VSDC isn’t any different than editing any other type of video since you just have to import a video into the editor, add it to the timeline and then remove all segments you don’t want to use. VSDC’s intuitive interface makes cutting, cropping or masking videos easy, as you can access any of these options with a single click. Moreover, the Video Stabilization tool enables you to turn shaky footage into perfectly smooth shots.

VSDC features a YouTube uploader and it lets you share your WebM videos to Facebook, Instagram or Vimeo. In addition, you can use this video editing software to change the format of your video files.

#### 2\. [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/)

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Linux

The support for a wide range of formats and a rich selection of video editing tools, make OpenShot an excellent choice for all video content creators who want to edit WebM videos. Besides the basic video editing options like resizing, cutting or trimming OpenShot is equipped with a title editor, an extensive library of visual effects and animation and keyframe options.

Each of these video editing tools can be used to make the footage saved in WebM format look more visually pleasing. Nonetheless, you are going to need at least basic video editing skills if you want to make the most of OpenShot’s video editing options.

#### 3\. [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Linux

Besides being one of the most popular cross-platform media players ever created, VLC is also equipped with a set of video editing tools. In addition to converting WebM video files, you can also edit this type of file with VLC. This media player grants you access to a variety of filters, effects and color adjustment options you can use to polish your WebM videos.

Moreover, VLC lets you trim or crop each video you open with it so that you can remove the parts of the WebM videos you don’t want to share with your online audience. Even so, the process of editing a video with VLC can be too complicated for PC and Mac users who are not tech-savvy.

## Part 2 Standard of Amazon Video Aspect Ratio

While watching videos online, Amazon Video dimensions matter a lot. It changes the viewer experience completely. Here, the Amazon Prime Video aspect ratio needs to be taken care of. But before moving ahead, it is essential to know what is meant by "Aspect Ratio"?

![video aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/video-aspect-ratio.jpg)

Aspect Ratio, in simple terms, is the ratio of the Width to the Height.

That is if talking about Amazon video aspect ratio. Then, it refers to the respective video width to height ratio visible on the screen. It is important as it affects the visual representation of the video playing on the net.

## Part 3 How to change the size of a video on Amazon Prime

A question that comes to the mind of most prime video users is, is there a way to change the size of a video on Amazon Prime?

For this purpose, you can take the help of the device on which you are streaming Amazon Prime Video with the required aspect ratio. That is, you can convert or change the aspect ratio to 16:9 Amazon Prime Video widescreen through your device. Some other aspect ratios that you can set are:

## Part 4 Why are Prime Movies, not Full Screen?

Are you facing the issue that Amazon Prime Video widescreen is not fully supported, or prime movies are not full screen? Well, there can be some reasons or problems due to which this happens. Such as Prime Video playing in Smart TV, Phone of Mi TV not appearing widescreen to have a better view or sometimes outline bars appear that makes the visible area quite less. What to do to solve the issue or if there exists some solution? Let's take a look over some of the reasons due to which Amazon Prime Video widescreen does not appear as required:

**●** Some of the devices do not support particular resolution videos.

**●** In some devices under the settings, there comes an app scaling option to make Amazon Prime Video widescreen. However, this is not the official way to do so, though it works many times. But, this option varies from system to system.

**●** This often occurs when the dimension of the device screen mismatch with that of the video aspect ratio. Since a 16:9 aspect ratio or 1920X1080 pixel resolution is required for a Full HD video, device dimension varies, say 2400X1080 pixels. Now, if you want to see your video in a 1:1 ratio, then around 240 pixel wide black bars will appear on either side of the video if kept in landscape mode.

Alternatively, if you try to zoom in on the video, black bars will disappear, resulting in cropping the video visuals from the side.

A possible solution can be using some [video editor software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) support to adjust the screen resolution or aspect ratio of the video as per the requirement of the device. For this purpose, one can refer to Wondershare Filmora video editor. That can be the perfect solution to this problem.

## Mac VLC Trimmer: Effortlessly Cut Videos Without Compromising Quality

# VLC Trimmer Mac: Best Way to Trim VLC Without Losing Quality

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions

_Is there a way to trim VLC without losing quality?_ Of course! Trimming VLC videos without losing quality can be a bit frustrating sometimes. Fortunately, there are applications available that can help you edit videos without losing quality. Wondershare Filmora is one such software that can be downloaded for free. You cannot miss it.

In this article, we will introduce why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality, then recommend 3 video editors trim high-quality video without lowering the quality.

* [Section 1\. Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality](#why-trim-vlc-loss-quality)
* [Section 2\. Video editor to trim VLC videos without loss of quality](#software-trim-vlc-without-loss-quality)

## Section 1.  Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality?

To understand quality loss, you first need to understand codecs, containers, and video re-encoding. This might get a little technical, so keep sipping that coffee!

#### 1\. Codec

Every video has a codec and a container associated with it. A video codec is an order in which the video data is organized for playback, editing, and other functions. There are lots of different types of codecs, and each of them has different functions and advantages.

#### 2\. Container

A container is responsible for holding video data and other information in a single file. Containers have file extensions like .mp4, .avi, .mov, etc. Some containers can only hold videos in one specific codec, while others can hold multiple codecs. Containers are also responsible for telling media players whether a video has audio or not.

Why are codecs and containers so important? Imagine if you watched a 1080p video (codec) on an old TV (container) – it would work, but would you really be interested in seeing it? Probably not. A mismatch between containers and codecs can result in poor quality, which is why you must shoot your videos in the right format and play them on the right platform.

#### 3\. Video compression and re-encoding

You might be wondering at what point of the whole process does the video loses quality. When you capture the video, it is of the highest quality. As soon as you compress it to share it online, some quality loss occurs, even if you convert it into a high-quality video.

When you export a video that’s already been exported, you re-encode the video. **Re-encoding a VLC video can result in even more quality loss.**

The truth is, you can’t reduce the video size without losing quality no matter what you do. If you’re editing a video shot in 4K, but you export it in 720p, the video will become compressed, and the original data of the video won’t get transferred to the new video, resulting in a pixelated block of mess.

When you make changes to a video with a **video trimmer app**, you’re changing the data structure that holds information about the video. Why do VLC videos that are small in size appear pixelated and blurry? It’s because they don’t have as much information as videos with larger sizes.

_Is there a way to trim VLC without losing quality?_ Of course! Trimming VLC videos without losing quality can be a bit frustrating sometimes. Fortunately, there are applications available that can help you edit videos without losing quality. Wondershare Filmora is one such software that can be downloaded for free. You cannot miss it.

In this article, we will introduce why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality, then recommend 3 video editors trim high-quality video without lowering the quality.

* [Section 1\. Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality](#why-trim-vlc-loss-quality)
* [Section 2\. Video editor to trim VLC videos without loss of quality](#software-trim-vlc-without-loss-quality)

## Section 1.  Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality?

To understand quality loss, you first need to understand codecs, containers, and video re-encoding. This might get a little technical, so keep sipping that coffee!

#### 1\. Codec

Every video has a codec and a container associated with it. A video codec is an order in which the video data is organized for playback, editing, and other functions. There are lots of different types of codecs, and each of them has different functions and advantages.

#### 2\. Container

A container is responsible for holding video data and other information in a single file. Containers have file extensions like .mp4, .avi, .mov, etc. Some containers can only hold videos in one specific codec, while others can hold multiple codecs. Containers are also responsible for telling media players whether a video has audio or not.

Why are codecs and containers so important? Imagine if you watched a 1080p video (codec) on an old TV (container) – it would work, but would you really be interested in seeing it? Probably not. A mismatch between containers and codecs can result in poor quality, which is why you must shoot your videos in the right format and play them on the right platform.

#### 3\. Video compression and re-encoding

You might be wondering at what point of the whole process does the video loses quality. When you capture the video, it is of the highest quality. As soon as you compress it to share it online, some quality loss occurs, even if you convert it into a high-quality video.

When you export a video that’s already been exported, you re-encode the video. **Re-encoding a VLC video can result in even more quality loss.**

The truth is, you can’t reduce the video size without losing quality no matter what you do. If you’re editing a video shot in 4K, but you export it in 720p, the video will become compressed, and the original data of the video won’t get transferred to the new video, resulting in a pixelated block of mess.

When you make changes to a video with a **video trimmer app**, you’re changing the data structure that holds information about the video. Why do VLC videos that are small in size appear pixelated and blurry? It’s because they don’t have as much information as videos with larger sizes.

## Section 2.  The software you can use to trim VLC videos without loss of quality

1. [Wondershare Filmora](#way1)
