* It takes an eternity for two videos clips to be merged
* Very few video formats supported/ only videos with the same formats can be merged
* Only videos with the same aspect ratio can be merged
* Poor quality on the output/resulting file, serious loss of quality from the sourcing files

In light of those above-mentioned reasons, it is wise for you to identify the following points before you move forward with your endeavor:

* The operation system of your computer, a Windows 7, or Windows8, Mac OS 10.10?
* The formats of your source video clips, .mp4, .avi, .flv, or any other popular formats?

After compression, you can upload and share the video to YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook and Google Drive directly or download it to computer. The free version of Clipchamp will **watermark video you compressed at the beginning and ending frames**, and if you want to [remove the watermark from a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you have to upgrade to the Business version of the video editor.
