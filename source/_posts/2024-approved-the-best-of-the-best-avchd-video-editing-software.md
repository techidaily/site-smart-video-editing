## Part 2: Bonus: Best 5 Premiere Pro Intro Templates Free Download

Let's see which websites you can use to download the intro and title templates for Premiere Pro.

### 16. [Motion Array](https://motionarray.com/browse)

In addition to an impressive library of intro templates, Motion Array offers presets, sound effects, royalty-free music, and stock footage.

Furthermore, you can choose the software version to make sure that the templates you download can be used with the version of Adobe Premiere Pro you have installed on your computer.

The website provides you with powerful search tools, so you can select the resolution of the template, up to 8K, or choose which types of templates are going to be displayed.

Using the free subscription plan can limit your options since you'll only be able to download free templates, and your upload storage will be limited to just 1GB.

The Pro subscription plan that can be purchased for $54 per month will grant you access to an almost endless selection of title templates as well as a huge selection of plugins for Adobe Premiere Pro.

![free premiere pro templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Motion-Array.jpg)

### 17. [Cinecom – Simple Intro for Premiere Pro](https://www.cinecom.net/designer-packs/simple-titles-for-premiere-pro/)

### 20. [RocketStock](https://www.rocketstock.com/free-after-effects-templates/free-cinematic-title-library-for-premiere-pro/)

This option is best suited for video editors who want to create their intros because RocketStok's Cinematic Style Library extends the scope of options provided by Premiere Pro.

Downloading all fonts except Helvetica Neue is free, but you must check which fonts you can use in commercial projects. You will have no trouble installing the fonts since you can just double-click on the font and follow the on-screen instructions.

Once you've installed all the fonts from the library, you can use them to replace the software's default library. You just have to click on the Replace Style Library option that can be accessed from Premiere Pro's Title Style tab.

If you don't feel comfortable creating your titles or if you simply don't have the time to create your own titles, the Free Cinematic Style Library is not the best choice for you.

On the other hand, Premiere Pro's users who don't often use title templates can benefit from downloading RocketStock's intro library.

### 19. [Videohive](https://videohive.net/category/premiere-pro-templates/titles)

Videohive is a part of the Envato Market platform that also features Web Themes and Templates, Code, Audio, or Graphic sections. It is free to use, but only a limited amount of assets can be downloaded for free.

To download an item, you must purchase it, and prices can range from $16 to $50 for a single title template.

Videohive is also a great source of title templates for Adobe After Effects, as it offers more than 5000 titles and intros that are compatible with this software.

Furthermore, you can download presets for both Premiere Pro and After Effects that can be used to create stop-motion animations, perform color correction, or make the footage look like it was captured with a VHS camera.

### 20. [RocketStock](https://www.rocketstock.com/free-after-effects-templates/free-cinematic-title-library-for-premiere-pro/)

This option is best suited for video editors who want to create their intros because RocketStok's Cinematic Style Library extends the scope of options provided by Premiere Pro.

Downloading all fonts except Helvetica Neue is free, but you must check which fonts you can use in commercial projects. You will have no trouble installing the fonts since you can just double-click on the font and follow the on-screen instructions.

Once you've installed all the fonts from the library, you can use them to replace the software's default library. You just have to click on the Replace Style Library option that can be accessed from Premiere Pro's Title Style tab.

If you don't feel comfortable creating your titles or if you simply don't have the time to create your own titles, the Free Cinematic Style Library is not the best choice for you.

On the other hand, Premiere Pro's users who don't often use title templates can benefit from downloading RocketStock's intro library.

## Part 2: Bonus: Best 5 Premiere Pro Intro Templates Free Download

Even though all websites we featured in this article offer some free intro templates for Adobe Premiere Pro. However, it is still a much better solution to buy a subscription plan on a platform if you are working on a large number of projects each month.

Let's see which websites you can use to download the intro and title templates for Premiere Pro.

### 16. [Motion Array](https://motionarray.com/browse)

In addition to an impressive library of intro templates, Motion Array offers presets, sound effects, royalty-free music, and stock footage.

Furthermore, you can choose the software version to make sure that the templates you download can be used with the version of Adobe Premiere Pro you have installed on your computer.

The website provides you with powerful search tools, so you can select the resolution of the template, up to 8K, or choose which types of templates are going to be displayed.

Using the free subscription plan can limit your options since you'll only be able to download free templates, and your upload storage will be limited to just 1GB.

The Pro subscription plan that can be purchased for $54 per month will grant you access to an almost endless selection of title templates as well as a huge selection of plugins for Adobe Premiere Pro.

![free premiere pro templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Motion-Array.jpg)

### 17. [Cinecom – Simple Intro for Premiere Pro](https://www.cinecom.net/designer-packs/simple-titles-for-premiere-pro/)

It is a designer pack that features ten pre-animated lower-thirds intro templates. You can change the duration of the font and color of the text in each template, and you can choose if you want to download a 1080 or the 4K version of the designer pack.

The templates are compatible with CS6, CC2013, CC2014, and CC2016 versions of the Premiere Pro. The Simple Titles pack can be easily installed, as you just have to drag and drop it into the software.

However, before you can download these title templates, you have to subscribe to Cinecom's mailing list.

Even though this can be a bit inconvenient, it is very well worth the trouble since you'll be able to transform or build upon the intro templates and use them freely in all videos you edit in Adobe Premiere Pro.

![title template for Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simple-titles-for-premiere-pro.jpg)

![free premiere pro templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Videohive.jpg)

### 20. [RocketStock](https://www.rocketstock.com/free-after-effects-templates/free-cinematic-title-library-for-premiere-pro/)

This option is best suited for video editors who want to create their intros because RocketStok's Cinematic Style Library extends the scope of options provided by Premiere Pro.

Downloading all fonts except Helvetica Neue is free, but you must check which fonts you can use in commercial projects. You will have no trouble installing the fonts since you can just double-click on the font and follow the on-screen instructions.

Once you've installed all the fonts from the library, you can use them to replace the software's default library. You just have to click on the Replace Style Library option that can be accessed from Premiere Pro's Title Style tab.

If you don't feel comfortable creating your titles or if you simply don't have the time to create your own titles, the Free Cinematic Style Library is not the best choice for you.

On the other hand, Premiere Pro's users who don't often use title templates can benefit from downloading RocketStock's intro library.

![free premiere pro templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/RocketStock.jpg)
