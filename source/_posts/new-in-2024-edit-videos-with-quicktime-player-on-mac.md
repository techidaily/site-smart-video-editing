VideoPix is another slow mo app that could play videos at 1ps to 60fps. You could swap between video edit and frame grabbing mode with a button tap. You could scan the frames one at a time and pick out your favorite scene.

If you can't get enough of the app running on your smartphones, then plugin that VGA or HDMI adaptor and watch the slow mo playback on your TV. You can do it wirelessly if that's what you prefer.
