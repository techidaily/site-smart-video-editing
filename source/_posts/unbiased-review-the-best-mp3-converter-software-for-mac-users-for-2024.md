The effect that comes up after adding two or more screens in a single frame is called split screen, and the tool that enables the users to do this is a **split screen video editor**. These split screens have significant importance in post-production tasks. That said, the following sections discuss about the tools that enable you to create split screen videos, and explain the process of doing so.

As mentioned above, the split screen effect lets you add two or more screens in a single frame. When multiple activities occur at the same time but at different locations, they all can be shown on one screen by placing their corresponding footages side-by-side or in any other arrangement that the **split screen video maker** allows.

## Best Split Screen Video Editing Software for Windows and Mac \[Free & Paid\]

After understanding what split screen is, it becomes both obvious and mandatory to know about some of the most used **split screen video editor** applications, and how they help you in adding the effect to your movies. Following is a list of a couple of such programs:

### 1. iMovie

**Step 3: Select Split Screen Preset**

However, as discussed above, there are several post-production tools, offline and online, that allow you to make split screen videos easily and without any cost.

**Conclusion**
