## Part 2: How to Install Android Video Editing Apps on Chromebook

Editing videos on a Chromebook can be beneficial for so many different reasons, but at the moment only a few Chromebooks allow you to use Android video editor apps. Even if your Chromebook supports Android apps it is possible that some apps cannot work properly on a Chromebook. Installing apps from a Google Play Store can at times be a somewhat complicated process so let's go through it step by step.

#### Step 1 Getting the Google Play Store App

The process of acquiring the Google Play Store app is different for Chromebooks that support Android app and for those that don't. It is of utmost importance to make sure that the OS you have on your Chromebook is at least version 53 or more recent, otherwise, you will not be able to get the Google Play Store App.

#### 1\. If your Chromebook supports Android apps

Once you've made sure that your Chromebook has the OS that supports Android apps, go to Status area, and look for the Settings cog. After the Setting window opens, click on the 'Enable Google Play Store on your Chromebook' check box located at the bottom of the Settings window under Google Play Store (beta) option. This action will open the Google Play Store app and you will be asked to accept the terms and conditions, click **Agree** and proceed to download the apps you want.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings.jpg)

#### 2\. If your Chromebook doesn't support Android apps

The process of gaining access to Google Play Store is more complicated if the Chromebook you have doesn't allow its user to run Android apps. In order to start this process, you first need to switch to the Developer Channel, which has its own risks. Back up all your data, before switching to developer channel, because returning to a stable channel requires you to do a factory reset.

To make the switch you'll need to go to Status area and click on Settings, this action will open the Settings page. Once the page is displayed on your screen click the About Chrome OS tab that shows which version of the OS you have installed on your Chromebook and which channel you are currently running.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings-2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings-2.jpg)

Click on More Info to expand the info about the Chrome OS, and look for a Change Chanel option. Clicking on the Change Chanel button will present you with three options Stable, Beta and Developer-unstable, select the last option, read the warning dialog box carefully and click Change Channel.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings-3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings-3.jpg)

Once all the necessary updates to put the device into Developer Channel are completed, you will be required to restart your Chromebook. After you have restarted your Chromebook, go to the Apps tray and you will see that Google Play Store app is now available. Click on it and go through the Terms and Conditions and click on accept.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings-accept](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings-accept.jpg)

#### Step 2 Getting Android Video Editing Apps

If you already have a Google Play Store account on your Android Smartphone, your Chromebook will automatically recognize it and allow you to log in, but if this isn't the case you'll have to set up a new account.

![android-on-chromebook-interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/android-on-chromebook-interface.jpg)

The process of getting android video editing apps is simple and very similar to the installation process of an app on an Android phone. Locate the app you want to install and click on the Install button. The process will start immediately, and you may be asked to give authorizations to install the app on your Chromebook, but that's the only action you'll need to perform during this stage of the process. After the installation is over you'll find your new video editing app in the App Tray, next to other apps you have on your Chromebook. Click on it to run the app and you are all set to start your first video editing journey on your Chromebook.

Keep in mind that how apps perform will largely depend on the Chromebook you have, so before choosing to download and install an Android video editing app, make sure that your device is capable of delivering a solid performance. Share with us about your opinion in the comment section below.

## Part 2: How to Install Android Video Editing Apps on Chromebook

Editing videos on a Chromebook can be beneficial for so many different reasons, but at the moment only a few Chromebooks allow you to use Android video editor apps. Even if your Chromebook supports Android apps it is possible that some apps cannot work properly on a Chromebook. Installing apps from a Google Play Store can at times be a somewhat complicated process so let's go through it step by step.

#### Step 1 Getting the Google Play Store App

The process of acquiring the Google Play Store app is different for Chromebooks that support Android app and for those that don't. It is of utmost importance to make sure that the OS you have on your Chromebook is at least version 53 or more recent, otherwise, you will not be able to get the Google Play Store App.

#### 1\. If your Chromebook supports Android apps

Once you've made sure that your Chromebook has the OS that supports Android apps, go to Status area, and look for the Settings cog. After the Setting window opens, click on the 'Enable Google Play Store on your Chromebook' check box located at the bottom of the Settings window under Google Play Store (beta) option. This action will open the Google Play Store app and you will be asked to accept the terms and conditions, click **Agree** and proceed to download the apps you want.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings.jpg)

#### 2\. If your Chromebook doesn't support Android apps

The process of gaining access to Google Play Store is more complicated if the Chromebook you have doesn't allow its user to run Android apps. In order to start this process, you first need to switch to the Developer Channel, which has its own risks. Back up all your data, before switching to developer channel, because returning to a stable channel requires you to do a factory reset.

To make the switch you'll need to go to Status area and click on Settings, this action will open the Settings page. Once the page is displayed on your screen click the About Chrome OS tab that shows which version of the OS you have installed on your Chromebook and which channel you are currently running.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings-2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings-2.jpg)

Click on More Info to expand the info about the Chrome OS, and look for a Change Chanel option. Clicking on the Change Chanel button will present you with three options Stable, Beta and Developer-unstable, select the last option, read the warning dialog box carefully and click Change Channel.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings-3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings-3.jpg)

Once all the necessary updates to put the device into Developer Channel are completed, you will be required to restart your Chromebook. After you have restarted your Chromebook, go to the Apps tray and you will see that Google Play Store app is now available. Click on it and go through the Terms and Conditions and click on accept.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings-accept](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings-accept.jpg)

#### Step 2 Getting Android Video Editing Apps

If you already have a Google Play Store account on your Android Smartphone, your Chromebook will automatically recognize it and allow you to log in, but if this isn't the case you'll have to set up a new account.

![android-on-chromebook-interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/android-on-chromebook-interface.jpg)

The process of getting android video editing apps is simple and very similar to the installation process of an app on an Android phone. Locate the app you want to install and click on the Install button. The process will start immediately, and you may be asked to give authorizations to install the app on your Chromebook, but that's the only action you'll need to perform during this stage of the process. After the installation is over you'll find your new video editing app in the App Tray, next to other apps you have on your Chromebook. Click on it to run the app and you are all set to start your first video editing journey on your Chromebook.

Keep in mind that how apps perform will largely depend on the Chromebook you have, so before choosing to download and install an Android video editing app, make sure that your device is capable of delivering a solid performance. Share with us about your opinion in the comment section below.

In addition, you can decide if you want to include the outline in the painting as well as set the size of the brush and how many levels the final image should have. Click on the Paint button and wait for SnapsTouch to generate the cartoonized picture, and you can then proceed to download it to your computer.

To use this online photo editor to cartoon, go to <http://www.snapstouch.com/Painting.aspx>.

### Part 2: 8 Free Online Photo to Cartoon Converters That You Should Try

Converting a photo into a cartoon automates this process, which makes cartoon converters a great option for anyone who finds online photo editing apps difficult to use. Here are some of the best online photo to cartoon converters you can use for free.

#### 1. KusoCartoon

You can cartoon a photo with the photo to cartoon converter even if you never went through this process before. All you need to do is upload the photo to the platform, pick the cartoon style you like and click on the Photo to Cartoon button.

The platform will automatically apply the effect to your photo and display the results after it cartoons the picture. If you are not satisfied with the results, you can change the cartoon style, reduce or increase the number of colors, and adjust the saturation and brightness values. In addition, the platform lets you decide if the lines in the picture are going to be thick or thin or how intense the shadows are going to be.

Convert a photo to cartoon with KusoCartoon: <https://kusocartoon.com/photo-to-cartoon.php>.

#### 2. pho.to

Cartoon is just one out of hundreds of effects the pho.to platform offers. In addition to cartooning a photo, you can also use this platform to retouch portraits, enhance photos automatically, or apply different types of visual effects.

You can upload a photo from your computer, your Facebook profile, or the cloud and the platform will cartoonize it as soon as the upload process is completed. In case you don’t like the results you can click on the Adjustments button and open the image in the pho.to’s editor to enhance its colors or apply stickers. However, all photos you cartooned with this photo to cartoon converter are going to be watermarked if you use its free version.

You can visit <https://funny.pho.to/cartoon/> to turn photos to cartoons with pho.to.

#### 3. Cartoonize.net

You can turn a photo into a cartoon in just a few moments with this platform. Cartoonize.net is going to apply a cartoon effect to a photo you upload automatically, but it also lets you choose from dozens of effects that make photos look like cartoons.

You just have to click on an effect you like in case you don’t like the effect the platform selected for you to apply it. However, you can’t fine-tune the effect’s settings, and some of your photos may not look perfect after you apply a cartoon effect to them. Besides cartooning photos, you can use this platform to perform basic photo editing actions like cropping or rotating, while the platform also offers powerful text tools that enable you to add text layers to photos you cartoon.

To cartoon a photo with Cartoonize.net, go to <https://www.cartoonize.net/>.

#### 4. PhotoCartoon

Creating cartoons from photos with this platform is a fun process anyone can complete. You just have to upload a photo via URL or from your computer and then proceed to choose one of the available cartoon effects.

You can choose from effects like Cartoon, Toon Cloudy, or Watercolor, and you can just click on the one you like to apply it to your photo. In addition, you can also add text to each photo you cartoonize with the platform and choose a font or the size and color of the text. Moreover, each effect can be adjusted using the Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, and Hue sliders. The only downside is that the platform watermarks all photos you edit with it and you must purchase the PhotoCartoon software in order to remove it.

Once the picture is uploaded you can set the Color Level, Smoothness, and Edge Size values before clicking on the Apply Effect button. You can then save the cartoonized photo to your computer, but you should keep in mind that you must enable Flash in your browser in order to use the Anymaking online photo editor.

#### 6. Picture to People

Picture to People is much more than a simple photo to cartoon converter, as the platform features a photo editor, text customization tools, and a broad range of other photo editing options. You just have to upload a photo in order to start converting it. After the picture is uploaded you can adjust Color Improvement, Color Detail, Contour Style, and Contour Strength options.

In addition, you can choose whether or not you want to make a soft drawing. In case you do, you can adjust the Softness Level and Softness Extent values and then click on the Generate button. The platform will take a few moments to cartoonize your photo, but you can only download the photo to your computer since Picture to People doesn’t have social sharing options.

Go to <http://www.picturetopeople.org/image\_effects/photo\_cartoon/photo\_cartoon.html> to convert photos to cartoons with the Picture to People converter.

#### 7. cartoon.pho.to

In addition to the Cartoon effect, the pho.to platform also features the Cartoons mode that cartoonizes photos automatically. Once you upload a picture from Facebook, your hard drive, or via an URL the platform will generate a preview where you can see how your cartoonized photo looks. Besides the Cartoon effect, this mode also offers the Face Morphing and Face Auto Crop options.

You should click on the Save and Share button if you like the result. However, fine-tuning the effect’s settings isn’t possible, so there isn’t much you can do if you didn’t like the results of cartoonization. Optionally you can open the photo you turned into a cartoon in the platform’s editor and add text layers, stickers or tweak the brightness and contrast values.

Visit <https://cartoon.pho.to/> to use the cartoon.pho.to tool.

#### 8. Prima Cartoonizer

All you need to do after you arrive at the Prima Cartoonizer’s home page is click on the Choose File button and the platform’s editor will launch as soon as the upload is completed. You can then start browsing through the huge collection of cartoon effects.

Once you find the effect you like you should click on it in order to apply it to your photo and then preview the results. Adjusting the effect’s settings is not possible, and some cartoon effects are only available on the desktop version of the app. Moreover, all photos you cartoonize on this platform are watermarked and you must install Prima Cartoonizer on your computer if you want to create watermark-free cartoons from your photos.

Want to convert photos to cartoons with Prima Cartoonizer, go to <https://primacartoonizer.com/>.

**Conclusion**

Online cartoon photo editors and converters are remarkably easy to use, and they enable you to turn any photo you take into an entertaining cartoon in just a few clicks. However, some of these online platforms watermark your pictures and don’t allow you to adjust the effect’s settings, which impact the quality of the final cartoonized photo.
