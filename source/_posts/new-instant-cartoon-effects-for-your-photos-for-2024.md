### Part 1: Best Free Online Cartoon Photo Editors

You don’t have to purchase an expensive photo editing software if you want to cartoon your photos because there are so many different online photo editing platforms that allow you to apply this effect to your photos for free. Let’s take a closer look at what they have to offer.

#### 2. BeFunky

Befunky is one of the best photo editors you can find online, which is why it is hardly surprising that it offers cartoonization effects. In fact, you can choose from **five different cartoonization effects** that are all equally impressive.

All of the cartoon effects Befunky has to offer are located in the Artsy menu, and you just have to click on Cartoonizer DLX, Cross Hatch DLX, Pop Art DLX, or Graphic Novel DLX effects in order to apply them to your photo. Furthermore, you can use the Erase mode if you don’t want to catoonize the entire photo or head over to the Adjust menu to specify the amount of the effect you’ll apply and increase or decrease the photo’s sharpness.

Go to <https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/> and you can then turn your photos to cartoon easily in BeFunky.

#### 3. Lunapic

This is yet another online photo editing platform that gives you access to a broad range of photo editing options for free. Even though a bit outdated, the Lunapic’s interface resembles Photoshop’s interface, so you won’t need much time to get used to it if you ever used Adobe’s iconic photo editing software.

Once you’ve uploaded a photo, you just have to go to the Effects menu and select the Cartoon option. Lunapic will then automatically apply the effect to the photo you uploaded and you just need to preview the image before you save it. The only downside is that you can’t adjust the effect’s settings in case you don’t like the results.

If you want to add cartoon effect to photo with this photo editor, you can go to <https://www12.lunapic.com/editor/?action=cartoon>.

#### 4. wish2be cartoon photo editor

If you would like to [turn yourself or your friends into a cartoon character](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Wish2Be cartoon photo editor can be a fun option. The platform’s Free Caricature feature allows you to become a cartoon character in just three easy steps.

You start by customizing the background, selecting the body type, hairstyle, or adding different accessories, gadgets, or even weapons. Once you are done, you can proceed to upload a photo of the person you want to turn into a cartoon character. Optionally, you can add a text layer and adjust its position and size within the picture. If you like the caricature you created, you can buy a print or you can choose to share your design for free. The Pro Cartoonizer feature this platform offers is only available if you purchase one of the available subscription plans.

Here is the website <https://www.wish2be.com/app/cartoon-photo-editor/> for cartoon photos with Wish2Be.

#### 5. SnapsTouch

This is a simple online photo editor that lets you turn your photos into sketches, paintings, or drawings. Choosing the Painting option is probably the easiest way to turn a photo into a cartoon, although this effect can also be achieved with the Pencil Sketch feature.

After you upload a photo you want to turn into a cartoon, you can choose between Painting 1 and Painting 2 options in order to determine the style of the cartoon you’re creating. In addition, you can decide if you want to include the outline in the painting as well as set the size of the brush and how many levels the final image should have. Click on the Paint button and wait for SnapsTouch to generate the cartoonized picture, and you can then proceed to download it to your computer.

To use this online photo editor to cartoon, go to <http://www.snapstouch.com/Painting.aspx>.

Besides the Cartoon effect, this mode also offers the Face Morphing and Face Auto Crop options.

You should click on the Save and Share button if you like the result. However, fine-tuning the effect’s settings isn’t possible, so there isn’t much you can do if you didn’t like the results of cartoonization. Optionally you can open the photo you turned into a cartoon in the platform’s editor and add text layers, stickers or tweak the brightness and contrast values.

Visit <https://cartoon.pho.to/> to use the cartoon.pho.to tool.

Online cartoon photo editors and converters are remarkably easy to use, and they enable you to turn any photo you take into an entertaining cartoon in just a few clicks.
