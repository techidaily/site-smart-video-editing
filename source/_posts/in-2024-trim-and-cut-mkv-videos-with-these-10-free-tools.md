 If you're looking for a web application to create and edit your videos, WeVideo is perhaps what you need. This online platform enables you to create videos in the cloud. That is to say, every single feature is accessible online, so you don't have to download other software. Below is a get-starting guide for WeVideo. Follow it to easily create videos online.

## #1 Sign in WeVideo

 It's free to get started with WeVideo. You just need to make an account by providing an email address, and creating a username and password. You can also sign in with your preexisting Facebook, Yahoo or Gmail account.

## #2 Import your photos or videos to WeVideo

 Then click _Upload Media_ in the _Storyboar_d tab or go to the _Upload_ tab to import the photos and video clips from your computer or media accounts. You can also hit _Record_ and connect your own camera device to record a video clip.

 Tip: WeVideo provides three editing modes (Storyboard, Standard Timeline and Advanced Timeline). You can switch between modes by clicking the triangle icon in the upper right corner of the screen in the editor.

![how to use wevideo](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/wevideo-add-files.jpg)

## #3 Polish your WeVideo creation

 After that, drag and drop your contents in any order you want. This will help you to organize your contents. Then you edit the video as you like. For example, you can trim your video clips to focus on some key moments or and cut a long video into smaller ones. You can also add text, effects, music, and graphics to your videos. Or go to the _Theme_ tab to add some creative themes to your creation.
