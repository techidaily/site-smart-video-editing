* [Lightworks](#tab%5F04)
* [ZS4 Video Editor](#tab%5F05)

#### 1\. Windows Movie Make

Windows Movie Maker is a great free video editing tool for Windows users. It’s able to handle the least video formats: **asf, avi, .m1v, mp2, .mp2v, mpe, .mpeg, mpg, mpv2, wm, wmv.**

It contains features like drag-n-drop functionality, transitions, titles, credits, timeline narration, and more. What’s more, you can even modify the existing effects if you have knowledge about using XML code.

![free avi video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/convert-video/windows-movie-maker.jpg "free avi video editor")

#### 2\. Avidemux

Avidemux is a basic yet very capable video editing program. It supports various video formats such as AVI, MPEG, MP4, and ASF. With it, you can easily splice video clips or add filters. Although this may sound overly simple, it’s actually robust enough to ensure that your videos look professional.

![free avi video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/avidemux.jpg "free avi video editor")

![supported-formats-fx](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/avidemux-formats.jpg)

#### 3\. VirtualDub

Virtualdub is a well-known video editing tool that allows you to capture video and perform video editing. It’s geared towards processing AVI files and able to do a variety of pre and post-processing operations on your video. With it, you can adjust the frame rate, remove audio tracks, resize, rotate, flip, adjust the brightness and contrast, and more. Reminder: while installing, it will write some preferences to the Registry.

![free avi video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/virtualdub.jpg "free avi video editor")

#### 4\. Lightworks

Lightworks is a free video editor but can handle most of what you’d expect from a professional video editing application. It supports a wide range of video formats like AVI, MOV, MPG, and more. Some of its outstanding features include video capture and import, GPU- accelerated real-time effects, color correction, autosave and media management, etc.

![free avi video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/lightworks.jpg)

#### 5\. ZS4 Video Editor

ZS4 Video Editor is another free video editing tool with over 150 built-in video effects including excellent color and chroma keying. Users can customize the width and height of the output video, add unlimited tracks and sub-composites, slave effects and change, compose controls to audio waveforms, and more. However, this software is lacking maintenance for long, not recommended in 2021.

![top avi video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/zs4.jpg "top avi video editor")

#### **Conclusion:**

Filmora, with its powerful features and frequent updates, can handle basically all video formats that you'll see every day while editing video. A user-friendly interface and low learning curve would help a lot for beginners to edit videos. More importantly, Filmora is totally free to try.

**G2 Rating:** 5 Stars

**Supported OS** [Windows](https://www.acethinker.com/video-convert-master), [Mac](https://www.acethinker.com/video-convert-master)

**User Review**

AceThinker Video Master is all about convenience. It provides you with a video editor, downloader, and converter in one package. An educator left a [review on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/acethinker-video-master/reviews/acethinker-video-master-review-2050643); they say, "This has saved me lost time, increased student engagement, and \[it is\] a wonderful training tool for other educators."

**Takeaway**

Is the storage space in your Windows PC running out? If that's the case, AceThinker Video Master is a fantastic tool for you. It's essentially four video apps in one package. And it's not too shabby as video editing software, either. Expectedly, it's not the best choice for making short films for competitions and projects of similar or bigger scale.

### 7\. VideoPad Video Editor - Best for Social Media Work

**Takeaway**

VideoPad Video Editor has many free features you can use to improve your videos. Admittedly, there are problems with some of these features. Nevertheless, this tool is a solid choice for a Windows iMovie alternative.

### 8\. Lightworks

Lightworks Pro is a video editor used to make some Oscar-winning films, and Lightworks is a free and less complicated version of it. However, Lightworks is still not that beginner-friendly. Therefore, it's best to consider this as an iMovie alternative only if you are an intermediate user.

![lightworks interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/10/imovie-for-windows-11-5.jpg)

**Key Features**

**G2 Rating: 3.5 Stars**

**User Review**

A [TrustRadius Ratings and Review](http://trustradi.us/A9272) says, "Lightworks is a great tool for a non-designer to use because it provides a number of tools and capabilities that can be quickly learned." However, they note that Lightworks does not provide advanced video editors with all the tools they need. It's best for intermediate users.

**Takeaway**

Lightworks is a fantastic alternative to iMovie for Windows 10+ users. However, it requires you to be quite knowledgeable about video editing tools. This editor has a slightly higher learning curve than others. But once you learn how to use Lightworks, creating quality videos would be super easy.

A [G2 reviewe](https://www.g2.com/products/flexclip/reviews/flexclip-review-5138003) r says, "I have used many video editing tools so far, but none is close to FlexClip when it comes to video editing."

**Takeaway**

You can't go wrong with FlexClip. It has powerful tools making it a great iMovie alternative for Windows. You don't even have to install it; it's an online tool. Unfortunately, that has some downsides. You need to wait for the website to finish loading before working because it scrolls down for each line that gets loaded.

### 11\. OpenShot - Best for Amateurs

![openshot interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/10/imovie-for-windows-11-1.jpg)

OpenShot has a straightforward interface, making it beginner-friendly. It has some fantastic tools you'll find helpful. There's a catch with beginner-friendly editors, though. They don't have the advanced features you can find on other video editors. You can say that for OpenShot.

* Keyframing
* Decent selection of templates and filters

**Price:** Free

 Pros

You can follow these tips to make good lyric videos:

**Accuracy**

You should make sure that there is 100% accuracy in the lyric video you are creating. If there are wrong lyrics on any of your lyric videos, your followers may not prefer watching your other lyric videos. So, double-check or triple-check the lyrics before sharing them with your fans.

**Theme/Background**

You should pick an attractive theme for creating an engaging video. No doubt, a video having a central theme attracts the viewers a lot.

**Color**

You should select an efficient and eye-catching color scheme for your lyric video. That is because it is helpful in elevating the visual appeal of the video, which in turn gains the attention of the viewers.

**Fonts**

A lyric video is all about fonts because the viewers are interested in reading the lyrics. So, you should select interesting fonts and should focus on font style, size, and color. The fonts should sync in with the video’s vibe so that the viewer can enjoy watching it.

**Transitions/Filters**

You should use filters that could blend with the song’s vibe. Choose the transitions that look natural and appealing. Never bombard your video with too many transitions and filters.
