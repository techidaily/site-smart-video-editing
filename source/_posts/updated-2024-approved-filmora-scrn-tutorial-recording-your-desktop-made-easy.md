Most of you must be wondering what is the purpose of changing the aspect ratio of a video. The aspect ratio is the size of the frame occupied by the video during the play mode. In other words, you can refer to it as the shape of the image concerning its width and height. There are surplus ways to change the size of the images but you must search for optimal tools to establish this task. While modifying the width and height values, make a note of the image resolution. You must resize the images without affecting the resolution and quality of the video. Making changes in one image parameter should not affect the other attributes.

![aspect-ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/aspect-ratio.jpg)

The Final Cut Pro app helps to carry out this task professionally without any issues. This video editor works on every detail of the video and implements respective changes on the image size retaining the quality of the file. Quickly scroll down for more details on the efficient utilization of the Final Cut Pro app in modifying the aspect ratio of the video.

Filmora offers two ways to make a slow-motion effect in a video.
