The process of swapping faces with this cross-platform app developed by Microsoft is automatic, so you just have to snap a quick selfie, find the picture of a celebrity or anyone else you’d like to swap faces with and let the app do the rest for you. To make things even better, you can swap multiple faces in a single photo, as the Face Swap app automatically finds faces in pictures and places a new face over them. However, the results you will be able to get won’t necessarily be perfect each and every time, so you have to arm yourself with patience and keep trying until you create an image you feel confident sharing on social media.

#### 5. Face App 4.2

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

![Best Apps to Change Face on iPhone & Android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/faceapp-change-gender.jpg)

Image from the Internet

Unfortunately, this app doesn’t have any face swap features, which means that you can’t really use it to [change faces](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with your friends. In case you want to see how you would look like if you had a different gender, a wider smile or if you were older or younger, then installing this app on your device is a good choice. Just keep in mind that the free version of the app offers only basic beautification tools and that you have to upgrade to the pro version in order to gain access to all the options this app has to offer.

#### 6. [Face Swap 4.3](https://apkpure.com/face-swap/com.fotoable.faceswap.c403)

**Price:** Free, contains ads

**Compatibility:** Android

As its name suggests, this app offers an abundance of face swapping options, so you can choose a motion face and add it to your video or utilize the Face Clone feature and copy a single face as many times as you want within a single video clip. Besides truly impressive face swap options, the app also offers some decent photo editing tools that let you enhance the colors, add stickers and text overlays or apply filters to your images. The Face Swap app enables you to share your creations on all popular social media platforms in just a few taps.

#### 7. MSQRD 4.3

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:**  Android

Image from the Internet

Are you a fan of video selfies? If so, you shouldn’t miss out on MSQRD, pronounced masquerade, because this cross-platform app offers so many entertaining features. You can easily become a cute animal, a movie superhero, or swap faces with your friends. What’s more, you can broadcast live videos on Facebook while having a mask over your face. The app also contains a rich filter gallery so you can make each 30-second video you record even more amazing. Besides Facebook, you can share the photos and videos you record and edit with MSQRD on any social network you choose.

**Compatibility:** iOS

![Best Apps to Change Face on iPhone & Android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Face-Swap-Live-app.jpg)

Image from the Internet

The Face Swap makes switching faces with your friends in real-time look easy because you just have to start recording a video, and the app will do all the work for you. What’s more, you can use this app to swap faces in photos, so you can become your favorite celebrity in just a few seconds. The [lite version](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/face-swap-live-lite-switch/id1077478814?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8) of the app is also available if you don’t want to spend your money on this app until you’ve tried what it can do. However, the app’s file-sharing capabilities are far from perfect.

#### 9. Face Swap Booth

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility** **:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/face-swap-booth-faceswap-multiple/id826921329?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.revosoft.faceswapbooth)

![Best Apps to Change Face on iPhone & Android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/face-swap-booth-face-changer.jpg)

Image from the Internet

You can add your face over a single photo as many times as you want, swap faces across several photos, change faces with superstars, and much more if you decide to install this app on your Smartphone. The advanced face detection technology automatically switches the faces in all photos with utmost precision, so you can focus on discovering ways to make your images as entertaining as they can possibly be. The only downside is that you will have to upgrade to the premium version of the app in order to be able to use all of its features.

Using this app is really simple, because you just have to select a picture that contains a face you’d like to use as your own, and the app will automatically make the switch. MixBooth lets you take photos or import images from your photo library or even from your Facebook account. In order to see how the final image is going to look like, you just have to shake your phone, and if you like the result, you can save a photo to your phone or share it on a social media platform of your choice.

**Bonus**

Instead, if you would like to do it on PC, I highly recommend you to watch this clip.
