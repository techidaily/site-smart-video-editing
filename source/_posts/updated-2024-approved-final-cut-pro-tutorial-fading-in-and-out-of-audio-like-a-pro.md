## Part 1: How to Fade Audio by using the Modify Menu

You can go to the **Modify** menu and easily apply fade-in or fade-outs to the audio clip you are editing. The Final Cut Pro preferences also allow you to adjust the fade duration.

**Step 1** **:** First, you have to select the audio or the video clips with audio in the timeline.

![ Select the audio or the video clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fade-audio-in-fcp-1.png)

**Step 2** **:** Select Modify> Adjust Volume> Apply Fades.

![Apply fades](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fade-audio-in-fcp-2.png)

You should remember that the fades appear at the beginning and the end of each clip. The default duration of the fade is one half-second. If you want to modify that duration, you just have to drag the fade handle up to the point where your fade is supposed to begin or end.

**Step 3**: If you want to remove the fades, choose Modify > Adjust Volume > Remove Fades.

## Part 2: How to Fade Music by using Fade Handles

You have already learned how to find the fade handles on the screen. Now, you just have to manually drag the handle to the exact point from which you want the fade to begin or end. Just keep in mid this simple rule: fade handles at the beginning of a clip produce fade-in effects, whereas fade handles at the end give fade-out effects.

You can manually fade-in or out a portion of the audio clip on your timeline by using the fade handles. Place the pointer over the clip and you can see the fade handles appearing in the top left and right corners of the waveform. To change the sound of the fade, you'll have to modify the shape of the fade by selecting one of the several preconfigured choices.

**Using the fade handles to create crossfades:**

**Step 1** **:** To create a crossfade, first you have to select two adjacent clips in the timeline. After that choose Clip> Expand Audio (or press Control-S). You can see the waveforms on your screen expanding.

**Step 2** **:** To overlap the audio parts of the two clips on your timeline, just drag the end point of the first clip and the start point of the second clip.

**Step 3** **:** Now, you'll have to drag the fade handles of each clip to the exact points where you want the fade to start and finish.

* Linear: The rate of change is constant over the length of the fade.
* S-curve: Eases in and out of the fade with the midpoint at 0 dB.
