Premiere Pro CC enables you to turn the raw footage captured by any camera in any format into awe-inspiring videos. Besides offering superb video editing options that include powerful color correction tools and amazing effects, the software also offers a decent amount of audio editing options.

The only downside is that Premiere Pro CC is not best suited for inexperienced video editors, and it takes quite some time to master all of its features.

#### **_6._** **_Vegas Pro_**

**Price:**$399.00

**Compatibility:** Windows

Although Vegas Pro has never been as popular as Premier Pro, the video editing options, Vega Pro offers are no less powerful than those provided by Adobe's famed video enhancer.

This video editing software lets you do virtually anything if you know how to do it. Multicam editing, a rich selection of effects, or support for a wide array of video file formats make Lightworks an excellent choice for skilled video editing professionals.

#### **_8._** **_Final Cut Pro X_**

**Price:** $249.99

**Compatibility:** macOS

The possibilities Final Cut Pro offers are nearly endless.
