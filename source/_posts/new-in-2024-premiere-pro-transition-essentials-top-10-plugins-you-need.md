Clipchamp features impressive stock audio and video libraries you can use to create soundtracks or as a source of complementary footage for your WebM videos. The free version of this online video editor only lets you export videos in 480p resolution and you cannot use the stock footage for free.

#### 5\. [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/video/)

**Price:** Free

Even though this is primarily a file conversion platform that enables you to change the format of images, PDF, audio or video files, you can also use Aconvert to edit your WebM videos. You can’t do much more other than cut, crop, rotate or merge video clips. In addition, you cannot upload video clips that are larger than 200MB to this platform which can make the video editing process difficult, since WebM videos can easily exceed this size limit.

Aconvert is far from being a perfect WebM video editor, but it still offers enough video editing options to enable you to create videos you can share online.

#### 2\. Edit the WebM video

Trim or cut some parts of the video based on your need. With Filmora, you can also rotate, crop, or change the orientation of the video easily. Besides, the titles library provides openers, titles, texts, lower thirds, or end credits, you can drag and drop it to the track above the video clip directly to apply them.

#### 4\. Export the edited WebM video

When you are ready, click the Export button. When you export the edited WebM video in Filmora, you can save it to MP4, MOV, MKV, F4V, WMV format, or MP3 even without none video converter, which is convenience.

**Conclusion**

Finding a video editing app you can use to process video files saved in WebM file format is no longer difficult since you can choose from a variety of desktop and web-based options. Online video editors offer a more modest set of video editing tools, which is the reason why you should only use them if you don’t want to perform complex video editing tasks.
