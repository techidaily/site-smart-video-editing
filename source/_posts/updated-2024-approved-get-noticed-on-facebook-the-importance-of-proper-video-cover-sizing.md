## Part 1 Key Facebook Cover Video Specifications

A Facebook cover video works like a mini-advertisement that is played on a loop continuously. To keep the visitors engaged and interested in the video, the video needs to look neat, clean, bright and in the right size and the aspect ratio to fit perfectly in the given space. Key specifications for the cover video are enlisted below.

**Video cover Facebook size**: As such, there are no specific size guidelines issues but it is recommended to keep the size of the video less than 1.75GB. The small size will ensure that users having slower browsing speed can also watch the video in a hassle-free manner.

Dimensions of the video: A video to be used as a cover should be at least 820 X 312 pixels and to get the optimum results it is suggested to keep it around 820 X 462 pixels. If you will watch the video on a desktop, it will be cropped from the sides, or the top or bottom. Thus, to ensure that the video looks perfect on a phone as well as desktop keep the aspect ratio at 16:9 and place the important text or other content at the center.

File type of the video: Videos in MP4 or MOV format are suggested to be used as the cover video and their resolution should be a maximum of 1080p.

Duration of the video: A Facebook cover video can be between 20 seconds to 90 seconds and you can also choose to play it on a loop.

## Part 1: What is the Bokeh Effect and Why Should I Be Using it?

The word “Bokeh”or “boke” refers to the Japanese concept of “blur.” It is, in its simplest form, a style of photography where one object is the primary focus, and everything else is strategically blurred.

Using the Bokeh effect is an excellent way to separate the focal point of your photo from non-focal points. It not only serves the purpose of highlighting the focus of the image, but can also help when you’re looking to get rid of an unpleasant or unwanted background. The blurred background is meant to keep your focal point at the absolute center of your audience’s attention.

The word “Bokeh”or “boke” refers to the Japanese concept of “blur.” It is, in its simplest form, a style of photography where one object is the primary focus, and everything else is strategically blurred.

Using the Bokeh effect is an excellent way to separate the focal point of your photo from non-focal points. It not only serves the purpose of highlighting the focus of the image, but can also help when you’re looking to get rid of an unpleasant or unwanted background. The blurred background is meant to keep your focal point at the absolute center of your audience’s attention.

Now, is there any Premiere transition you like? If you have picked one, now let's to add it to Premiere Pro. Here are few easy to follow steps for your Premiere Pro transition effects.

### Step 1: Go to Effects panel

Go to Premiere Pro interface and select **Effects** panel from available options. Now from the available transition folders, pick the one that suits your project editing needs. The types of numbers of transitions available in effects panel will depend upon the version of Premiere Pro that you have installed in your system. Some of the most common transition effects are listed below:

* **Zoom:** Zoom transition helps to work on a selected potion of screen and it brings scene in or out in a selected proportion from whole screen.
* **Slide:** In this sliding motion type transition effect, one scene floats over another.
* **Wipe:** This one is quite interesting where one shot complete replaces the selected another shot while travelling from one portion of the frame to another.
* **Iris:** The iris transition effect is a newer one where an artificial effect is created to reflect the actual opening and closing motion of camera iris during shooting.
* **3D Motion:** Such type of transition effects tries to manipulate selected clips in the space. For instance, if you apply flip over transition in this 3D motion category then one clip will simply flip over screen in such a manner that secondary clip below it gets revealed in appealing manner.
* **Dissolve:** In this type of transition effect, one scene completely melds into another scene. You can describe such type of blends with terms like fade out and fade in from or to a bank image.

Effects folders usually contain stylistically similar kind of transitions, but the result different appearances are on screen.
