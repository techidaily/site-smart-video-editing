## 1\. Change the power mode

 The default power plan in Windows strikes a balance between power consumption and PC performance, which is a good choice most of the time, especially when you’re not using resource-hungry applications a lot. But games usually need more resources than other regular software programs, so it’s not a bad idea to switch to the **High performance**  plan to see if it helps to drive the FPS and fix the stuttering problems.

To change the power mode:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and **R** at the same time, then type **powercfg.cpl** and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/run-dialog-powercfg.png)
2. In the pop-up window, expand **Hide additional plans** and select **High performance** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/control-panel-power-options.png)
3. Then run Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora to see if the frame rate is higher, and if the stuttering issue is improved. If the problem remains still, please move on to the next fix.

## 2\. Update Windows

 If the low FPS and stuttering with Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora happens all of a sudden, you should check to see if your system is fully updated.

To make sure that you have the latest available updates installed:

1. On your keyboard, hit the**Windows** key, then type**check for update** s, then click C**heck for updates** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-18.png)

## 3\. Update graphics card driver

 An outdated or incorrect display card driver could also be the culprit to the low FPS and stuttering problem in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, so if the above methods don’t help to improve the FPS or the stuttering situation, it’s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated graphics driver. So you should update your drivers to see if it helps.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image.png)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-1.png)  
**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
4. Restart your PC for the changes to take effect.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Launch Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora again and see if the latest graphics driver helps to improve the FPS and stops the stuttering. If this fix doesn’t work for you, try the next fix, below.

## 4\. Add Avatar to the exception list in Windows Security

 Adding Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora to the Windows Security exception list helps to stop the latter from scanning the former every 5 seconds, and can therefore help to stop the stuttering and FPS dropping by granting the game more resources.

To do so:

1. On your keyboard, hit the **Windows** key, type and select **Windows Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-25.png)
2. Select **Virus & threat protection** from the left side pane, then select **Manage settings** under Virus & threat protection settings.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-26.png)
3. Scroll down a bit to select **Add or remove exclusions** under the**Exclusions** section.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-27.png)
4. Click **Add an exclusion** , then select **File** , and browse to the folder where you save the Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora execution file.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-29.png)
5. There, you’ve successfully added**Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora** to the Windows Security exclusion list.

 Restart Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and see if its FPS still drops and stutters. If so, please move on.

## 5\. Verify game files

 Corrupted or missing files will cause problems like FPS drops and stuttering in your Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. To see if this is the case, you can verify your game files on:

* **[Epic Games Launcher](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## 6\. Modify Registry Editor

 There are some gaming-related settings that you can modify in the Registry Editor to see if they help to improve the FPS and the stuttering situation for all games. If you haven’t tried them yet, here’s what you can do:

**WARNING** : Incorrectly modifying Registry Editor files could cause severe computer problems, so please make sure that you always create a backup or a restore point for your computer first before you change anything in the Registry Editor.

1. Firstly, create a system restore point as instructed here: [How to enable and create restore points in Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) (the screenshots here are from Windows 10, but the instructions work on Windows 11 as well).
2. On your keyboard, press the **Windows** key and the **R** key together. Type **regedit** and hit **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-27.png)
3. Go to `**Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\System\GameConfigStore**` , then double-click the**GameDVR\_Enabled** entry on the right-side panel.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-48.png)
4. Change the value to**0** , then click**OK** to save.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-49.png)
5. Then go to`**Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PolicyManager\default\ApplicationManagement\AllowGameDVR**` , and double-click**value** on the right-side panel.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-50.png)
6. Change the value to**0** and click**OK** to save.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-51.png)
7. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

 Launch Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora again to see if the above changes help to fix the FPS dropping and stuttering problems. If not, please restore your computer to the previous state with the restore point you created in step 1, then move on to the next fix.

## 7\. Close resource-hungry programs

To do so:

1. Right-click the Windows taskbar and select **Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-48.png)
