This is the step where things change, of course! Now, rather than choosing MP4, you should select the "MOV" format for your output type! This will ensure that your MP3 file is converted specifically to a MOV file.

**Step 3: Convert!**

Again, just like before, select "CONVERT" to start the conversion process from **MP3 to MOV**!

**Step 4: Open Folder to Find File!**

Then, finally, go to the "Finished" tab to find your new MOV file.

## Part 2 **Six Online and Free Mp3 to Mp4 Converter**

For this next section, we're going to introduce a couple of **online MP3 to MP4 converters** as well other general, paid, and **free MP3 to MP4 converters** that you can check out. A link to a video showing how the converter works, as well as brief descriptions for each converter, have also been provided to ensure that you have a good idea of how each one works!

### 01**[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

The first of the tools on this list is Filmora! Filmora, first and foremost, is an advanced video editor. Some might say that using it as a tool to simply convert **MP3 into MP4** is a little bit of an overkill.

But, chances are, you're not likely going to want to stop at converting your MP3 into an MP4 file anyway, right? Well, if that's the case, then having an all-in-one tool on your side that can offer you endless options for all sorts of purposes is one way to ensure that you are starting off on the right foot from the very beginning!

### 02Zamzar

Zamzar is a Windows 10 app that works as a general conversion tool. It doesn't just convert **MP3 into MP4** or **MP3 into MOV** — it also does the job if you're looking for a converter that will work on JPG to PNG or PDF to JPG, etc. That makes it a helpful tool to have on hand just for general conversion purposes.

### 03Online File Converter

Online File Converter, as you can probably guess from the name, is an online conversion tool! This tool, much like Zamzar, is a heavy-hitter when it comes to conversion inputs and outputs compatibility. So, not only are you able to do the general **MP3 into MP4** conversion promised today, but you can do other things as well! Plus, no download or installation is required! All you need is an internet connection to access the website the converter is on and a little patience while you wait to upload, convert, and download the file in question.

### 04Any Conv

AnyConv is an alternate to the Online File Converter if you're looking for an online solution, but you don't like the interface of one or the other. The two are pretty much identical in terms of features. All you need to do in order to use it is to upload the file that you want to convert, choose a format, and then download the output file when you're done!

### 05Uniconverter

Uniconverter is an online **MP3 to MP4** tool from Wondershare (the same creators of Filmora Pro). It's a very solid tool. And it's quite a convenient one too. Since, just like any online converter, all you need to start using it is an internet connection.

### 06MConverter - Chrome Extension

Our last pick brings us back to unique solutions! Specifically, we're delving into the realm of Chrome extensions! This tool, the MConverter, works similarly to the other converters on this list. But, of course, in this case, if you want to use it in order to convert your files, you must first download the plug-in to your Chrome browser!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Despite the variety of options out there for **MP3 into MP4** converters, they all pretty much work the same. First, you upload the file that you want to convert. Second, you select the output format for the conversion. And finally, third, you finish the conversion!

**●** Most MP3 to MP4 converters work for other formats as well. For example, if you want to convert your **MP3 to MOV** instead — that's possible! OR, if you want to do the opposite, and convert **MP4 to MP3**, that works too!

**●** The difference between the different audio-to-video converters is usually the type of extra features it comes with as well as from what platform you can use it. For the latter, there are software types that you download and install to your computer, online types that you access through the internet, and extensions that you plug into your browser! Pick the one that works best with your workflow.

## Part 1 **Easy Steps on Convert MP3 into MP4**

For the first part of this article, we'll be covering how to use a **free** **MP3 to MP4 converter** in order to successfully change the format of your audio into a video file! There will be two examples given for this, one for the straightforward **MP3 into MP4** conversion the other for the more specified **MP3 to MOV** conversion!

### 01How to Convert MP3 to MP4?

**Step 1: Launch MP3 to MP4 Convert (for Windows)**

For our example, we'll be using the **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, EaseUS Video Converter! This is open-source software, so you can use it for free!

To start using your chosen **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, upload the file that you want to convert! For our example converter, it's as simple as dragging and dropping your chosen MP3 into the interface (as pointed out in the image below.)

![Launch MP3 to MP4 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%201.png)

**Step 2: Choose Output Format!**

Once the MP3 file has been uploaded, choose your desired output format.

(For our example **MP3 to MP4 converter**, this means selecting the settings icon for the file in question and then choosing a format from the pop-up window that appears (shown in the image below).

![Choose MP4 Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%202.png)

**Step 3: Start Converting!**

Once you've chosen your desired output format (which in this case is **MP3 into MP4**), select the "CONVERT" button to finish up!

![Convert MP3 into MP4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%203.png)

**Step 4: Save MP3 Into MP4**

Depending on your chosen **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, your new MP4 file may have to be downloaded manually or not.

In the case of EaseUS Video Converter, it is downloaded automatically, all you have to do is select the "Finished" tab and select "OPEN" to go directly to the file location.

![Open Finished MP4 File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%204.png)

### 02How to Convert MP3 to MOV?

We've also included how you can convert **MP3 to MOV** with the same tool! As you will surely see, much of the process is the same. Only one step is really changed!

**Step 1: Uploaded MP3 File!**

First, just like in the previous section, upload your MP3 file (by dragging and dropping the file onto the **MP3 to MOV** converter.)

![Choose Files for Upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%205.png)

**●** Despite the variety of options out there for **MP3 into MP4** converters, they all pretty much work the same. First, you upload the file that you want to convert. Second, you select the output format for the conversion. And finally, third, you finish the conversion!

**●** Most MP3 to MP4 converters work for other formats as well. For example, if you want to convert your **MP3 to MOV** instead — that's possible! OR, if you want to do the opposite, and convert **MP4 to MP3**, that works too!

**●** The difference between the different audio-to-video converters is usually the type of extra features it comes with as well as from what platform you can use it. For the latter, there are software types that you download and install to your computer, online types that you access through the internet, and extensions that you plug into your browser! Pick the one that works best with your workflow.

To convert the 4k video footage to mp4 formats or any other formats, such as AVI, MOV, 1080p/720p/480p MP4, and WMV, you should begin by downloading the [Wondershare Video UniConverter](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/)

#### Step 1. Import files

You should import the video files which you wish to convert to the Converter tool. There you have an option of directly using drag and drop into the application or by going to the ‘File’ button in the menu bar and choosing ‘Load Media Files’.

#### Step 2. Setting the desired format

**Conversion of videos to the 4K MP4 format:**

By clicking on the ‘Format’ button which is found at the bottom of the panel, it will open the dialogue box of the format window. In the ‘format’ icon, you will find the ‘video’ option. There select the format of ‘4K Video MP4’.

**Conversion of 4K or Ultra HD videos into other audio and video formats.**

Start by clicking the ‘format’ button found below on the screen. In the ‘format’ option select ‘video’ or ‘audio’ categories, this is where you will find various audio and video formats. Select the one which you require.

For converting 4K or Ultra HD format video into MOV, WMV, HD MP4, MKV, WMV etc. in 720p or 108p, follow this method. Go to the ‘format’ icon and select the ‘HD’ option. Click on the ‘settings’ option on the bottom right side to open the settings popup, here you can select video resolutions from 1920\*1080 or 1280\*720.

#### Step 3. Conversion of videos

Click on to the ‘Convert’ icon to start the process of converting videos from 4K MP4 videos to other formats or vice versa.

## Part 2: How to Download 4K Videos to MP4

#### Step 1.Installing the 4K Video Downloader

The foremost step is downloading the software and getting it installed. After installation, launch this program and browse through it to get a hang of it. Its user-friendly interface will make your work a lot easier.

![How to convert and downlaod 4k video in MP4 Format<](https://images.wondershare.com/video-converter-ultimate/guide/get-started-4.jpg)

#### Step 2. Search for the 4K videos you wish to download

4K videos are supported in the browsers of Chrome, Firefox, and IE. In any of these browsers go to the media streaming websites. Search for the type of 4K videos you like. Select one and play that video.

![How to convert and downlaod 4k video in MP4 Format<](https://images.wondershare.com/video-converter-ultimate/guide/download-5.jpg)

#### Step 3. Download 4K videos

In the browser when your video is loading, you will find a floating Download button. It will emerge at the above right corner of the video frame. Now one can download the video directly by clicking on to that download button. Then the program will start to analyze. You can also find video-related information like download speed, size, and name of the video during download.

![How to convert and downlaod 4k video in MP4 Format<](https://images.wondershare.com/video-converter-ultimate/guide/download-6.jpg)

Another way to download the 4K videos is by copying video’s URL and pasting it into the URL space given at the above left of the program’s screen. Then the downloading process starts. You should opt for dragging the URL into the program if the file size is huge. Because waiting for the video to load becomes arduous.

Once the process of downloading is complete, double-click on the video from the Download category to play. If the size of the 4K video is huge, try converting it into different formats. So you can easily import it into your other portable devices. You can do this by clicking on the ‘convert’ button which is displayed on the right side.

If you want to edit the downloaded and converted MP4 video footage, we recommend you to try [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which is also supporting 4k video footage editing. Or you can check some [free video editing software for mp4 video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
