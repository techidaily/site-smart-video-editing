## Part 1: How to get and download Final Cut Pro demo for 90 days?

 As it might be clear by now, Final Cut Pro is a professional video editing software and a product for Apple. Also, Final Cut Pro costs hundreds of dollars [(See details about Final Cut Pro price here)](https://filmora.wondershare.com/final-cut-pro/final-cut-pro-price.html) if you choose to purchase, so the 90-day offer has come in as a massive relief for those who want to try its features for free for more days. People who are already using the earlier Final Cut Pro trial version will be able to use it for another 90 days without paying anything.

* **Step 2:** You will be asked to enter your first and last name along with your email address. Please fill in all the details. After that, click on the blue tab that says download free trial. The total size will be 2.7GB.

And for those who are trying out Final Cut Pro, here is a collection of [FCPX tutorials](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for you to get started with!

## Part 2: Why Final Cut Pro trial won't open?

 Although there shouldn't be any issue in downloading the Final Cut Pro trial version, if you meet your system's requirements, some customers are complaining that they can't download or install the Final Cur Pro trial package. Well, if that's happening, there could be a few reasons which are highlighted below.

![fcpx-in-mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/fcpx-in-mac.jpg)

**Poor Internet Connection**

The most common reason for not being able to download Final Cut Pro 90 days trial version is you have a poor internet connection. You may feel that you have a superb browsing speed, but if your downloading speed is slow, the file may encounter some glitches, eventually ending up with a broken Final Cut Pro Trial file. And once the package is broken, you won't be able to install the installer package. Also, the downloading file is quite huge, and you need to have a proper internet connection. So, before contacting Apple to check whether your internet connection is strong or not.

**Check System Requirements**

To download the Final Cut Pro free trial version, your Mac system has to meet Apple's minimum requirements. Even if one of the requirements fails to meet, you won't be able to download Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial. To try the latest version, the OS has to be 10.15.6 or later. Your system must have 4GB of RAM and a metal-capable graphics card. The disk space should be 3.8GB. Ensure that your system meets the requirement. If the OS is not updated, update it before trying to download the package.

**Try Using Another Account**

Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial is essentially available for new users or those already using the 30days free trial. For those who are already on the 30-days free trial, the free trial package will automatically get extended. But Final Cut Pro already has your account details. Hence, if your previous free trial expired already, you may face some issues when trying to download, launch, or run the latest 90-days free trial offer. So, you can use another account and sign up and then try to download the newest version.

**Quit and Restart your System**

If you have successfully downloaded and installed Final Cut Pro but are unable to launch Final Cut Pro even after refreshing memory, probably, there is a minor glitch on your system. The primary thing to do would be trying to restart your system and then check if you are able to launch it now.

**Disconnect External Devices**

If you are using a malfunctioning or incompatible external device, even then, you may face problems while running Final Cut Pro. To resolve this issue, first shut down your system. Now, apart from the mouse and keyboard, disconnect every other external device that you are using. Next, reset NVRAM and now try to launch Final Cut Pro; it should operate normally now.

## Part 3: How to reset the Final Cut Pro trial before it expires?

 Final Cut Pro free trial version will be over after 90 days because that's their policy. Unfortunately, this means that once the free trial version is over, you will have to buy Final Cut Pro to continue using it. However, there is a way to reset it. But first, you need to check if your Mac has swift library installed. If it is installed and running, go on and enter the code mentioned below in the terminal and then hit enter. After everything is done, the code will be executed, and the rest of the free trial version will be completed.

 ![trial-expire](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/trial-expire.jpg)

Code to reset Final Cut Pro 10.4.4

 #!/usr/bin/swift

 import Foundation

 let path = URL(fileURLWithPath: NSString(string: "\~/Library/Application Support/.ffuserdata").expandingTildeInPath)

 let data = try! NSData(contentsOf: path) as Data

 let dictionary = try! NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveTopLevelObjectWithData(data) as! NSDictionary

 let mutableDictionary = dictionary.mutableCopy() as! NSMutableDictionary

 for (key, value) in mutableDictionary {

 if value is NSDate {

 mutableDictionary\[key\] = Date()

 }

 }

 try! NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: mutableDictionary, requiringSecureCoding: false).write(to: path)

 print("You'd better buy it")

 It's quite complicated that you will have to enter this code manually into the terminal each time the trial expires. Regrettably, there is no way to extend the free trial permanently, so you will have to repeat this part over and over again.

But to be aware, this may lead to a ban or other punishment to your account by Apple Inc.

Anyway, it makes sense why people want to stick to their free trial! Final Cut Pro is not an affordable video editing tool.

If you love fcpx that much but can't afford it, [see how to get fcpx with the cheapest price here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Or, you can try other powerful editors with much lower prices, like Filmora.

## Part 4: FAQ

**What is the limitation of the trial version of FCPX?**

Final Cut Pro Additional Content, which includes over 1300 royalty-free sound effects for use in your projects, isnâ€™t available in the Final Cut Pro trial. The trial is fully functional otherwise.

You can import media, edit, organize, add effects, color correct, export files in a variety of professional formats, and more. Get an overview of Final Cut Pro.

**Is Final Cut Pro worth the price?**

Final Cut Pro comes with robust video editing features, which can help you create stunning and professional-level videos. However, Final Cut Pro is not for beginners, and if $299 is a little too expensive for you, it is better to find another video editing tool that won't cost you this much and will let you create professional-looking videos effortlessly. This is when Filmora by Wondershare comes into play.

## Part 2: Why Final Cut Pro trial won't open?

 Although there shouldn't be any issue in downloading the Final Cut Pro trial version, if you meet your system's requirements, some customers are complaining that they can't download or install the Final Cur Pro trial package. Well, if that's happening, there could be a few reasons which are highlighted below.

![fcpx-in-mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/fcpx-in-mac.jpg)

**Poor Internet Connection**

The most common reason for not being able to download Final Cut Pro 90 days trial version is you have a poor internet connection. You may feel that you have a superb browsing speed, but if your downloading speed is slow, the file may encounter some glitches, eventually ending up with a broken Final Cut Pro Trial file. And once the package is broken, you won't be able to install the installer package. Also, the downloading file is quite huge, and you need to have a proper internet connection. So, before contacting Apple to check whether your internet connection is strong or not.

**Check System Requirements**

Your system must have 4GB of RAM and a metal-capable graphics card. The disk space should be 3.8GB. Ensure that your system meets the requirement.

Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial is essentially available for new users or those already using the 30days free trial. For those who are already on the 30-days free trial, the free trial package will automatically get extended. But Final Cut Pro already has your account details. Hence, if your previous free trial expired already, you may face some issues when trying to download, launch, or run the latest 90-days free trial offer. So, you can use another account and sign up and then try to download the newest version.

**Quit and Restart your System**

If you have successfully downloaded and installed Final Cut Pro but are unable to launch Final Cut Pro even after refreshing memory, probably, there is a minor glitch on your system. The primary thing to do would be trying to restart your system and then check if you are able to launch it now.

**Disconnect External Devices**

If you are using a malfunctioning or incompatible external device, even then, you may face problems while running Final Cut Pro. To resolve this issue, first shut down your system. Now, apart from the mouse and keyboard, disconnect every other external device that you are using. Next, reset NVRAM and now try to launch Final Cut Pro; it should operate normally now.

## Part 3: How to reset the Final Cut Pro trial before it expires?

 Final Cut Pro free trial version will be over after 90 days because that's their policy. Unfortunately, this means that once the free trial version is over, you will have to buy Final Cut Pro to continue using it. However, there is a way to reset it. But first, you need to check if your Mac has swift library installed. If it is installed and running, go on and enter the code mentioned below in the terminal and then hit enter. After everything is done, the code will be executed, and the rest of the free trial version will be completed.

## FCPX Survival Guide: Overcoming Common Obstacles and Challenges

# Troubleshooting Tips for Final Cut Pro X

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

Most of the time, Final Cut Pro X works great. But, when it doesn't, here are some things you can try to get your system back to normal in no time.

Here's the quick list:

* [Quit and restart Final Cut Pro](#part1)
* [Check your media](#part2)
* [Delete render files and re-render](#part3)
* [Create a new library](#part4)
* [Create a new user account](#part5)
* [Trash FCP X Preferences](#part6)
* [Remove and re-install Final Cut Pro](#part7)

#### 1 Quit and restart Final Cut Pro

Restarting Final Cut releases and refreshes memory so that if something was confusing your system, restarting Final Cut can fix it.

![restart fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/restart.png "restart fcp")

#### 2 Check your media

![check your media](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/image-size.png "check your media")

Frequently, problems are caused by still images that are too big. Limit your digital photos to no more than 5,000 pixels on a side. Final Cut is a video editor, not a still image editor. Images that are too large cause problems.

Also, stock footage files are known to cause problems. Be sure to convert all stock footage to ProRes 422 before importing into Final Cut Pro X.

#### 3 Delete render files and re-render

Open your Project in the Timeline and choose File > Delete Project Render Files. Render files can become corrupt. Trashing them forces Final Cut to create new render files which often will fix the problem.

#### 4 Create a new library

Create a new library and a new project. Then, copy and paste sections of the old project into the new project. Test each section until you find the spot that doesn't work. At which point, you can remove or replace the bad media.

![Create a new library](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/new-project.png "Create a new library")

#### 5 Create a new user account

![Create a new user account](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/new-ccount.png "Create a new user account")

Open System Preferences > Accounts and create a new User Account. This resets all preferences for both Final Cut and the operating system back to factory defaults. The only problem with doing this is that a new user account can't access files stored in the Home directory of the old user account. For this reason, I always recommend storing all libraries on external hard drives, not the Home Directory.

#### 6 Trash FCP X Preferences

Trash Final Cut Pro X preference files. There are at least three preference files and, if you've had a crash, there can be more. Here are the steps:

* Go to the Finder.
* Hold down on the Option key and click on the Go menu. The Library folder inside your Home Directory now shows up as a selection inside this menu. (You could also type Shift+Command+G, or select Go > Go To Folder in the Finder; then, type \~/Library/ and click Go.)
* Open to the Library > Preferences folder.
* Trash com.apple.FinalCut.LSSharedFileList.plist
* Trash com.apple.FinalCut.plist
* Trash com.apple.FinalCut.UserDestinations.plist
* Trash any other files that start with "com.apple.finalcut".
* Empty the Trash.
* Restart Final Cut Pro X.

#### 7 Remove and reinstall Final Cut Pro

If all else fails, delete FCPX from the Applications folder and re-install it from the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12).

One of these techniques should fix your problem. If not, it's time to contact [Apple Support](http://www.apple.com/support/).

**\# Recommendation:**

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

The staggering amounts of video content on the Internet are making it difficult to attract the attention of the audience you are targeting. Summarizing the highlights of your video in a short twenty to thirty-second trailer is one of the techniques you can use to spark the audienceâ€™s attention and ultimately increase the number of views your videos are getting.

Besides the promotional purposes, you can also use trailers to create entertaining short videos in order to have fun with your friends. Fortunately, you donâ€™t need a [professional video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) suite to perform this task since there are hundreds of [video editing apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that allow you **to create trailers on iPhones and iPads.**

So, in this article we are going to take you through the top ten movie trailer apps for iPhones and iPads you can use to create eye-catching trailers for all types of videos you create.

## Top 10 Movie Trailer Apps for iPhones and iPads

Selecting the footage you are going to include in the trailer you are making, is probably the most difficult part of the process, since most movie trailer apps for iPhones and iPads offer customizable templates. In addition, the music you choose as the soundtrack for your trailer needs to match with the visuals and the editing style you opted for. Letâ€™s take a look at the top 10 movie trailer apps for iPhones and iPads.

### 1\. [iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193)

**Price:** Free

All iPhones and iPads offer a free way to edit all videos you record with them. All you need to do is make sure that iMovie is installed on your iPhone or iPad and you can start editing the footage you recorded. In addition, you can also import videos recorded with different types of cameras into iMovie, as long as they are saved in the file format that is compatible with this app.

iMovie offers a variety of predesigned trailer themes, so you just have to pick the one you like the most and then choose the footage you want to include in your trailer. Keep in mind that you cannot add music to any of the trailer themes, but you can export the trailer you created and create the soundtrack from iMovieâ€™s Video mode. Whatâ€™s more, you can also use this app to [add transitions](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), visual effects or [titles](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to the trailers you create with iMovie.

### 2\. [Intro.Maker +3D Movie Trailer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/intro-maker-3d-movie-trailer/id1204817203)

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

![ Intro.Maker +3D Movie Trailer ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/intro-maker-3d-movie-trailer.jpg)

You donâ€™t have to be a seasoned filmmaker to create professionally looking trailers with Intro.Maker + 3D Movie Trailer. The app lets you choose from hundreds of HD templates that can be customized quickly to meet the demands of your project. Moreover, you can create your own templates and use them on all future projects. Videos that are saved on the deviceâ€™s camera roll can be easily imported into the app, which means that you can start making a new trailer just moments after recording the footage.

The trailers you create with the free version of Intro.Maker + 3D Movie Trailer are going to be watermarked and you must make an in-app purchase in order to [remove the watermark](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Furthermore, features like Voice Record, Transitions or Fonts are not available on the free version of the app, which is the reason why it is advisable to purchase a monthly or the annual subscription if you are planning to create trailers with this app on a constant basis.

### 3\. [Intro Designer Lite â€“ Create Intros for iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/intro-designer-lite-create-intros-for-imovie/id488748114)

**Price:** Free

![Intro Designer Lite &  Create Intros for iMovie ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/intro-designer-lite-create-intros-for-imovie.jpg)

The fact that Intro Designer Lite has more than five million downloads says a lot about its popularity. This iOS-based app is equipped with just six built-in templates, but you can download two more for free. Creating new trailers, openers or end credits requires you to go through three easy steps since you only have to select the template, add the footage and export the video.

Additionally, you can use this app to snap photos that you can use in the final cut of your trailer. Intro Designer Lite allows you to move and rotate all pictures you take with it so that they fit the trailer perfectly. This movie trailer app for iPhone and iPad devices is equipped with a plethora of text tools, which enables you to resize, move or even [animate all text](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you add to the trailer you are working on. The best part is that you can save all your projects, and continue working on them whenever you want.

### 4\. [Intro Maker â€“ YT Intro Designer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/intro-maker-yt-intro-designer/id1190034759)

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

![ Intro Maker- yt intro designer Movie Trailer ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/intro-maker-yt-intro-designer.jpg)

There are more than a thousand available templates, while new templates are added on a weekly basis, which means that you are never going to run out of ideas for your next intro.

Besides the rich selection of templates the Intro Maker grants you access to hundreds of fonts, and effects stickers you can add to your projects with a single tap. Creating the soundtrack for the intro youâ€™re working on is easy since there are more than 200 songs and sound effects to choose from. The number of projects you can create is not limited and each of them can be saved, which allows you to just modify an existing intro or a trailer and use it for a different purpose. However, you must upgrade to the VIP version of the app if you want to use all of its features.

### 5\. [Intro Maker: Vlog Video Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/intro-maker-vlog-video-maker/id1358216337)

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

![ Intro Maker: Vlog Video Maker   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/intro-maker-vlog-video-maker.jpg)

Making a trailer or an intro for the videos you share online shouldnâ€™t take too much of your time. This iPhone app offers an easy solution to all vloggers and video content creators who want to create trailers for their film projects from their phones. There are more than a thousand customizable templates to choose from, as well as over 700 motion stickers. In addition, the app doesnâ€™t limit the number of titles you can add to a single project, and it lets you adjust the size, shadow and stroke values for each title you include in a video.
