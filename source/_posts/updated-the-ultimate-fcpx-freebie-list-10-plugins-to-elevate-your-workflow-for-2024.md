**YouTube to Mp3** Converter is a program or platform that will let you transform YouTube videos to audio format, i.e., MP3, mainly observed when we wish to convert the video into the audio format, as the audio is critically more important than the video.

Now we're here to explore further the format by converting YouTube MP4 videos to MP3.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert YouTube Videos to MP3?](#Part 1)

02 [What Should Consider Before Choosing Suitable YouTube to MP3 Converter?](#Part 2)

## Part 1 How to Convert YouTube Videos to MP3?

320YTmp3 is an easy-to-use YouTube converter that extracts YouTube audio files at a good quality.

**Steps to convert YouTube to MP3 using 320YTmp3.**

## Part 2 What Should Consider Before Choosing Suitable YouTube to MP3 Converter?

### 01Look for the best SaaS App

First off, you wish to go for a SaaS app that works well on your desktop screen.

You want to use an app that does YouTube to MP3 format for PC. It should work on Mac and Windows OS.

### 01Feature of Batch Conversion

You may also desire the potential to convert YouTube playlists to MP3\. Again, the batch transform will save time in pasting and copying links.

And you may be looking for mobile compatibility as well. In such a scenario, you can look for a vendor with a YouTube to MP3 app. And, if the brand of your smartphone is Android, then you may be looking to go for that.

### 01Format Compatibility

Besides converting YouTube to MP3, various other audio formats could be desirable.

Then, there's a quality output level worth considering in a YouTube to MP3 converter. You may be enough or satisfied with lower bitrates like 96kbps in the interest of saving storage space.

Last but not least, you are looking for a platform that's trustworthy and reliable. You don't want your mobile or computer device's security compromised.
