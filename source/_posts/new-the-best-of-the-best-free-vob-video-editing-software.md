Video editing used to be a long and complicated process, but today **recording and editing a short video** with your Smartphone is as easy as taking a selfie. A growing number of apps also offer royalty free music so their users can create perfect lip-sync videos. These apps enable you to **be a part of a community of short music video creators** and to produce entertaining videos in which you dance and sing to your favorite songs.

If you want to become a part of this thriving community, but don't know which app to use, you've come to the right place, because in this article we are going to introduce you to some of the best apps for making music videos on iOS and Android smartphones.

## 8 Best Video and Music Editor

#### 1. TikTok (including Musical.ly)

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/ro/app/tiktok/id835599320?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ss.android.ugc.trill&hl=en%5FUS)

**Price:** Free, contains in-app purchases

![best music video maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-short-video-sharing-platform.jpg)

A short while ago TikTok and Musical.ly merged into a single app that lets you create lip-sync videos effortlessly. The app grants you access to a sizeable music library where you can find music from Pop, Rock or R&B genres, so you just have to browse through it and select the song you like and hit the Record button afterward. The TikTok's video editing features include easy-to-use cut and trim tools, duplicate video and merge options that allow you to have complete creative control over the footage you record.

In addition, you can add visual effects and stickers to your videos and if you decide to go live you'll be able to use some of the live streaming filters. Besides being a solid video and music editor, TikTok Including Musical.ly is also a social network that has millions of users. You can browse through music videos posted by other creators on this platform and find inspiration for your next project.

#### 2. Video FX Music Video Maker

**Compatibility** **:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.videofx&hl=en%5FUS)

**Price:** Free

![best music video maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videofx-music-video-maker.jpg)

Making lip-sync videos with this app is easy, but you must use your own music since the Video FX Music Video Maker doesn't offer royalty free music library. You can either use an MP3 file or record your own voice to make the soundtrack for the video. The app offers advanced video recording options, so you can pause and resume shooting at any moment or use the Start Timer option to give yourself time to prepare before the recording starts. The newly added Stop Motion feature enables you to animate your music videos, while the Fast Motion recording mode allows you to speed up all movement in the video.

Video FX Music Video Maker features more than fifty effects that can help your videos stand out. The app's file sharing options are more than decent as you can share videos on Facebook, Instagram or TikTok Including Musical.ly directly from the app.

#### 3. Triller

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.triller.droid&hl=en%5FUS), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/triller-music-video-maker/id994905763?mt=8)

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

![best music video maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/triller-video-maker.jpg)

Focus on your performance and let the app do the rest for you. You can dance, sing or act goofy in your music videos and Triller will edit your videos automatically. If you want, you can also use the app's trim or cut tools to remove any part of the video clip you don't like. The only downside is that music videos you record with Triller can't last longer than 30 seconds.

The app's music collection includes some of the most popular songs at the moment, so you can even participate in different music challenges or create lip-sync videos with music from your favorite singers. Triller lets you draw over videos, apply different visual effects or add text overlays, but some of these features must be purchased, as the free version of the app offers only a limited amount of ways to edit music and video.

#### 4. Video Star

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/video-star/id438596432?mt=8)

**Price:** Free, monthly subscription: $4.99

You can learn how to make music videos with Video Star in a short period of time, even if you never recorded or edited a video before. Just select a song from your music collection and start shooting. You can record your videos wherever you want, although you should avoid making videos in dimmed rooms since the lack of light may drastically decrease the quality of your footage.

The process of editing a video with Video Star is fun because you can trim or cut your videos, [clone yourself](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), make stop-motion animations or slow-motion videos. However, purchasing power packs, or opting for a monthly subscription is necessary if you want to gain access to all of the features the app has to offer. You can save your videos to your camera roll or share them to your social media accounts directly from the Video Star video editor.

#### 5. MuStar: Lipsync Musically Video Editor

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.qstudio.mustar&hl=en%5FUS), [Android](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mustar-lip-sync-musical-battle/id1179466049?mt=8)

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

![best music video maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mustar-lip-sync-musical-battle.jpg)

This unique platform enables music video creators to battle with other creators or participate in dance contests and earn stars. There are thousands of songs and movie excerpts to choose from, so you can just pick a song you like and use the app's lip-sync and dance mechanics to make incredible videos.

After you finished recording you can slow down your clips or use effects such a Black and White or Shine. You can share each video you make with the MuStar app to all popular social media platforms, which can help you get more followers. Even though the app can be downloaded from the App Store or the Google Play Store for free, if you want to use it on a constant basis, you'll have to choose your preferred subscription method.

#### 6. Music Video Maker

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BestPhotoEditor.MusicVideoMaker&hl=en%5FUS)

**Price:** Free

![best music video maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/music-video-maker-app.jpg)

Creating a great soundtrack with Music Video Maker is simple because you can just select a song and cut or trim the parts you don't want to use in the video. The app's video editor lets you apply effects, add frames and text overlays, while you can also import as many as sixty photos from your camera roll and turn them into an HD video.

However, the Music Video Maker is primarily a photo editor, which means that it lacks some of the frequently used effects that are commonly used in music videos that are posted on TikTok and other similar platforms. The app contains ads, which can slow you down during the video editing process. Despite all of these downsides, Music Video Maker app still offers powerful tools that enable its users to create music videos quickly.

#### 7. Fideo Music Video Show

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.zentertain.funvideo&hl=en)

**Price:** Free

![best music video maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fideo-music-video-show.jpg)

The app's user-friendly interface makes it easy to create and discover music videos. Downloading Fideo Music Video Show will make you a part of the global community of music video makers, so you can become friends with like-minded people and follow their work. The process of making a music video with Fideo is straightforward since you only have to select a song from the app's music library that contains thousands of sounds and songs and record the lip-sync video. The video editing features enable you to polish your videos in any way you want and share it with other Fideo users to get likes and comments.

## Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try

In today's world, photos and videos are an integral part of everyone's life. Mobile phones, laptops, and cameras may all be used to capture them. But, it might not be easy to organize and decorate them according to one's unique preferences. Fortunately, there are several tools available to help Apple users with these tasks.

In the following part, I will introduce 5 best apple video editing software, including its unique features listed.

### 1\. Photos

**Supported By:** iOS/macOS/iPadOS

**Pricing:** Free to use

The number one on our list is the Photos app. It's among the most well-known application for video editing enthusiasts in the iOS community. This is an application mostly used by professional designers and developers who are into the video editing profession.

**What Can You Do with Photos App?**

Apple Inc. created Photos, a picture storage and editing program. Its main features are its simplicity and ease of usage. Its very name is a lovely and obvious indication of its use. Since 2015, this Mac picture editing app has been offered for OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 and tvOS v.10.

Filters and Smart Sliders are among the editing tools available in this program. It also has the Mark-up tool that allows you to **add text**, shapes, and doodles, as well as signatures. What’s more, you can **rotate, crop and auto enhance** videos in this app as well. Like photos editing, if you are not satisfied with the editing, you can tap **Revert** to restore to the original version.

If you are using the Photos app on iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, you can **adjust the focus points and the depth of the field** in Cinematic mode to make a cinematic-looking video easily.

* **Edit Videos Anywhere with iCloud Photo Library**

The connection with iCloud Picture Library is where Photos outperforms every other Mac image editing tool. This fantastic feature allows users to fill out their libraries rather than their devices. This is accomplished by syncing photographs and videos across all Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, MacBook and Apple Watch.

* **Moments**

Photos employs Moments as an organizer, which may be used to build categories and years. Moments are a mix of the photo's time and location information. Furthermore, facial recognition enables users to create groups based on a person, among other things.

* **Themes**

Themes, which allow users to make calendars, picture albums, and other projects, complement the modifying and organizing capabilities. The program also provides printing capabilities for professional results.

### 2\. QuickTime Player

**Pricing:** Free to use

Next on our list is the QuickTime Player that lets you do almost whatever you want to do with your videos and pictures. The app is built to support both beginners and professionals. However, we would lean more towards beginners because most professionals today prefer apps like iMovie or Final Cut Pro. But that's not to say this one doesn't have excellent features to offer.

**What Can You Do with QuickTime Player App?**

* **Trim, Combine,** **Rotate, Split MOV Video**

Everyone wants to make their lengthy videos short. QuickTime allows you to do precisely that with its trimming feature. Make your videos short and catchy with this feature. Further, you can combine two videos to make one excellent video for your presentation. The app also allows you to split different videos and combine them to produce more quality content.

* **Record Screen and Voiceover**

If you think your video footage can do well with a background voiceover of someone else, QuickTime Player allows you to record your audios in the background while your video plays smoothly. You can also record the desktop screen with the Player.

If you believe your video looks better with a small size in appearance, try shrinking it using the shrink feature in the QuickTime Player. You can lower the video quality from 1080p, 720p to whatever your phone or Mac storage deems compatible.

### 3\. Clips

**Supported By:** iOS/iPad

**Pricing:** Free to Use

You might not have heard of Clips as much as you may have heard about the others on this list. But don't sleep on this one. Clips have slowly but surely gained the attraction of expert video editors, and you'd see almost all of them having Clips on their iPhones or Macs.

**What Can You Do with Clips?**

Apple Clips is interesting to check out when you're an iOS fan. You can use this free video editing app to record and edit 16:9, 4:3 or square videos with various camera effects, stunning filters, animated text, music, emoji, stickers, and more, and then share it with your friends or family.

* **Family-Oriented**

Apple Clips is mainly oriented towards families and children, and it isn't even close to the capabilities of iMovie. Nonetheless, it is moving closer to be a genuine video editing program with each new version.

* **AR Spaces**

Apple Clips, for instance, introduced AR Spaces, an augmented reality function for iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro owners, in April.

* **Cinematic Mode**

**What Can You Do with iMovie?**

iMovie, is more like Final Cut Pro X's younger sibling. But it's free with your Mac, so there's no danger in giving it a shot. It's an excellent option for newcomers learning to use editing software, casual enthusiasts, and even YouTubers who wish to cut up their films.

* **Merge, Cut, Trim: Pull off Everything!**

Although iMovie is rather simple, this may be considered a benefit for inexperienced editors. You can combine, cut, and rearrange your original video and audio with iMovie.

* **4K Video Editing**

You may even export your work in 4K quality at up to 60 frames per second once you've done it. Many effects, transitions, filters, and fine-tuning settings for white balance, color matching, and audio isolation are also included.

* **Cinematic Mode**
