For macOS 10.12 or later

Filmora video editor allows you to adjust the brightness with the auto enhance feature in one-click. What’s more, it provides the color match feature which allows you to match the color between different clips.

### **2\.** VSDC Free Video Editor

The VSDC Free Footage Editor, in the hands of a skilled user, can generate some truly professional-looking videos. The application supports virtually all major video formats and includes complex video effects such as object transformation and color correction, and also advanced audio effects such as volume adjustment and sound normalization. You have the luxury of brightening your videos simply by uploading the video from your desktop and making whatever changes that you want to make.

VSDC Free Video Editor is actually free, unlike certain "high-end" editors. You may utilize the whole feature set of the application without having to contend with annoying watermarks. Unfortunately, there is one snag. You must pay if you want technical assistance. (And there's a strong possibility you'll have to.) Subscription for the VSDC Free Video Editor is $1 per month, $5 per half-year, and $10 per year.

### **3\.** iMovie

iMovie for Mac allows you to experience your films in new ways. Make Hollywood-style teasers and gorgeous movies in excellent 4K resolution by quickly browsing your footage and instantly sharing your best moments. Color Balance and Color Correction are two options for brightening a movie in iMovie 10.1 or later. The former has four tabs: Auto, Match Color, White Balance, and Skin Tone Balance, which allow you to make automated color adjustments.

The latter has sliders for manually adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation, shadows, and other parameters. Simply choose the clip you want to change and then select the appropriate tool from the toolbar above the viewer. It's not very technical, but it makes it simple to brighten up a gloomy video.

### 4\. **Premiere** Pro CC

Premiere Pro includes a user interface that is both appealing and versatile. The startup feature enables you to rapidly return to previous projects, start new ones, or browse for Adobe Stock video. You can switch between workspaces for Assembly, Editing, Color, Effects, Audio, and Titles, and the dark system window tends to make your videos the focus of attention.

Premiere Pro CC is another desktop video editor that you can use to brighten your videos. The various parameters in the Lumetri Color panel window inside Premiere Pro CC may be used to accomplish video color correction.

Premiere Pro's Lumetri Color Tools elevate the application to the level of Photoshop for video. These tools provide a surprising amount of color modification and a wide range of film and HDR effects. With keyframes, you may modify the white balance, exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, and black point, among other things. Modifications for Saturation, Vibrance, Faded Film and Sharpen are also accessible.

### 5\. Final Cut Pro

Final Cut Pro comes with a set of robust manual color correction features that can be used to achieve a wide range of color correction and enhancement features. Creating a color correction effect and then modifying the effect's settings in the Color inspector is how you utilize the tools. Any of the following color correction effects may be used to make manual color modifications to the color tint, brightness, and contrast of the entire clip picture.

Color correction capabilities in Final Cut Pro allow you to fine-tune the look of any video in your project, including still photos, by adjusting color balance, shadow levels, mid-tone thresholds, highlight levels, and much more. Saturation, exposure, and color modifications are all controlled via the Color Board. Adjust the Brightness in the color adjustment panels to brighten your movies.

**Conclusion**

Adjusting brightness has become a "small problem" for many. Oftentimes, you record a video, and it falls short of the brightness criteria – it's too dark! However, when you have quality **Video Brightness Editors**, like the ones we have reviewed above, you're in good hands. Not only are these apps easy to use with excellent functionality, but they also make editing a piece of cake for everyone.

Yes, it is possible to reverse the order of video frames in order to arrange them in such a way that last frame appears first following the reverse sequence so that first frame goes to the last position in the clip.

#### **Rewind:**

 Reaching the widest audience possible is the goal of every video content creator, but achieving this goal might be impossible if the videos you share online are not saved in the right file format. [MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is probably the most common video file there is, because it is compatible with a broad range of [media players](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), as well as [online video hosting](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and social media platforms.

 Trimming the WebM videos is yet another option you will have at your disposal if you choose to convert your files with CloudConvert. In case you’re planning on using this file conversion platform on a regular basis, you can choose how many conversion minutes you’re going to have every month.

### 8\. [Video2Edit](https://www.video2edit.com/convert/webm-to-mp4)

It is worth noting that converting a video larger than 500MB with this platform isn’t possible, regardless of the subscription model you choose.

### 10\. [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/video/webm-to-mp4/)

 When done, simply click on the Convert Now button and then after the conversion process is completed, proceed to download your video to your computer. The only downside is that you cannot convert WebM video files that are larger than 200MB with Aconvert.

## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files. Which WebM to MP4 converter do you like to use the most? Share your opinions with us in the comments.

## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files. Which WebM to MP4 converter do you like to use the most? Share your opinions with us in the comments.
