When you're new to video editing software, it can be very easy to become frustrated and overwhelmed, so it's great for those who aren't familiar with it. It's all about getting that video off your memory card and putting it out there. That's it.

##### Cons

You cannot edit footage from your phone or DSLR with Quik App for Desktop - only GoPro footage can be used in Quik App. This is a GoPro app, after all. It should be used with GoPro content!

In addition to the ten free songs, GoPro Plus members have access to an additional song library. Users cannot import their own music either.

Additionally, you may only create a certain number of Highlights. Each 30-second video is limited to 10 Highlights.

## Final Verdict

Although GoPro Quik is amazing and comes with a lot of features, there are still many limitations of this application, as discussed in the cons section of this article. If you want to do basic editing, then this app will do just good, but if you are looking for advanced features like audio normalization, keyframing, color tuning, gif support, etc., then you will have to use another fully-fledged video editing app. We recommend you to give a try to our [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editor.

Filmora comes with plenty of features and can easily compete with the most advanced video editors in the world. The best thing is, you can download and install it for free and try all of its features without paying a penny. Also, there is an amazing community and Filmora support that you won’t find anywhere else.

Importing, basic terminologies, cutting clips, and adding music, as well as adding effects, titles, and exporting the finished material, are all covered in this video. It's more of a trawling movie than a fast instruction at over one hour long. However, it's ideal for novice users who want to take things a little more slowly and absorb knowledge over time.

**Why recommend this channle?**

• Extensive yet still very well-paced for beginners.

• Amazing teaching skills.

However, all the video tutorials are quite long because FCPX is powerful but not easy to get started with. You can always choose Wondershare Filmora to boost your editing.

## Part2: **The Best Websites to Read about Final Cut Pro Basics**

If you are looking for the best websites to learn Final Cut Pro basics, then you can visit the following web pages:

### 1.[FCP.co](https://fcp.co/)

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-fcp-co](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-6.jpg)

FCP.co is dedicated to all things video on the Mac, focusing on Final Cut Pro X video editing techniques and lessons. They're continuously updated on the latest FCPX third-party plugins and filters (including many free effects). Unlike Apple's FCPX user forum, this one is quite active and updated frequently.

### 2.[Apple Support Center](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/resources/)

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-apple-support-center](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-7.jpg)

On Apple's official website, the FCPX support community is active. If you have a specific query regarding the application, this is an excellent resource. The emphasis here is less on editing style, and skill since most content focuses on more technical FCPX software/hardware concerns. It's worth mentioning that if you contribute to the community by assisting other users with their problems rather than just asking questions, your editing karma will skyrocket!

### 3.[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/finalcutpro/)

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-reddit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-8.jpg)

If you want to ask a specific question related to Final Cut Pro, you can post it on Reddit. The active community on Reddit will answer it. You can also read the questions posted by other users to increase your knowledge.

### 4.[FCPX.tv](https://fcpx.tv/)

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-fcpx-tv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-9.jpg)

FCPX.tv, with its motto "all things Final Cut Pro X," is a one-stop shop for the most up-to-date advice and news on this software. An endless list of Final Cut Pro X requests (for future versions and upgrades), FCPX editing lessons, and documentation of known FCPX issues are just a few of the highlights. If you're an FCPX power editor, this is a must-visit website.

## Part3: Is Paid Class of FCPX Worth For Beginners?

The last thing you want to do with your hectic schedule is sitting through hours of aimless video lessons. Buying Final Cut Pro lessons gives you the feel of having a personal trainer working alongside you. You can enroll in FCPX paid courses on Udemy and Coursera. Often a certificate of completion is available for download at the end of the course.

However, if you are a beginner, we won't recommend you buy paid courses. There is unlimited free content related to Final Cut Pro available on YouTube and other websites that you can access without spending a penny.

When you have to spend too much money and energy on an editing tool, consider if it's really worth it. Rather, you can always choose a much easier yet still powerful editor like Filmora to save your time for better editing.

Even if you discover competent video editing teachers on YouTube, there's a high chance they won't teach you how to use the particular program function you need. It's incredibly aggravating to spend so much time looking for what you need!

But don't lose heart just yet. You can discover a professional video editing instructor that offers a variety of free lessons, tips, and tools for beginners and professionals with a bit of assistance.

This is the beauty of editing. Watching lessons on this channel will assist you in putting some of these advanced concepts, shortcuts, and tips into practice as they become second nature to you.

![the-best-fcpx-maroos rocha](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-3.jpg)

### 4.Brad and Donna – Game-Changing Plugins

Everyone needs and appreciates free things, whether they're new to FCPX or a professional editor. Your budget will not always be sufficient, and you will frequently find yourselves at a fork in the road when the funds are few. So, the good news for FCPX editors is that there is a slew of free plugins, including overlays, LUTs, flares, and titles, that are very excellent (and don't seem like your dingus friend produced them). You can watch the tutorial course if you want to learn more about these free and paid plugins in all price ranges.

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-brad-and-donna](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-4.jpg)

• Tips about various effects, color grading, graphics, keyframes, etc.

• Posts new content every week.

### 5.Totally Exposed – Complete Guide for Beginners

Are you new to Final Cut Pro X and don't know where to start? If you're new to FCPX and want to get started with video editing, you can join this FREE hour-long in-depth training that will get you up and running in no time!

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-totally-exposed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-5.jpg)

When you're learning from a seasoned expert, it's easy to feel left behind as they go through tools and features you've never heard of. On the other hand, the Totally Exposed channel puts such concerns to rest with one-of-a-kind lessons in which we learn with Neil, a novice who has never used FCP X before.

Importing, basic terminologies, cutting clips, and adding music, as well as adding effects, titles, and exporting the finished material, are all covered in this video. It's more of a trawling movie than a fast instruction at over one hour long. However, it's ideal for novice users who want to take things a little more slowly and absorb knowledge over time.

**Why recommend this channle?**

• Extensive yet still very well-paced for beginners.

• Amazing teaching skills.

However, all the video tutorials are quite long because FCPX is powerful but not easy to get started with. You can always choose Wondershare Filmora to boost your editing.

## Part2: **The Best Websites to Read about Final Cut Pro Basics**

If you are looking for the best websites to learn Final Cut Pro basics, then you can visit the following web pages:

### 1.[FCP.co](https://fcp.co/)

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-fcp-co](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-6.jpg)

FCP.co is dedicated to all things video on the Mac, focusing on Final Cut Pro X video editing techniques and lessons. They're continuously updated on the latest FCPX third-party plugins and filters (including many free effects). Unlike Apple's FCPX user forum, this one is quite active and updated frequently.

### 2.[Apple Support Center](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/resources/)

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-apple-support-center](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-7.jpg)

On Apple's official website, the FCPX support community is active. If you have a specific query regarding the application, this is an excellent resource. The emphasis here is less on editing style, and skill since most content focuses on more technical FCPX software/hardware concerns. It's worth mentioning that if you contribute to the community by assisting other users with their problems rather than just asking questions, your editing karma will skyrocket!

### 3.[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/finalcutpro/)

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-reddit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-8.jpg)

If you want to ask a specific question related to Final Cut Pro, you can post it on Reddit. The active community on Reddit will answer it. You can also read the questions posted by other users to increase your knowledge.

### 4.[FCPX.tv](https://fcpx.tv/)

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-fcpx-tv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-9.jpg)

FCPX.tv, with its motto "all things Final Cut Pro X," is a one-stop shop for the most up-to-date advice and news on this software. An endless list of Final Cut Pro X requests (for future versions and upgrades), FCPX editing lessons, and documentation of known FCPX issues are just a few of the highlights. If you're an FCPX power editor, this is a must-visit website.

## Part3: Is Paid Class of FCPX Worth For Beginners?

The last thing you want to do with your hectic schedule is sitting through hours of aimless video lessons. Buying Final Cut Pro lessons gives you the feel of having a personal trainer working alongside you. You can enroll in FCPX paid courses on Udemy and Coursera. Often a certificate of completion is available for download at the end of the course.

However, if you are a beginner, we won't recommend you buy paid courses. There is unlimited free content related to Final Cut Pro available on YouTube and other websites that you can access without spending a penny.

When you have to spend too much money and energy on an editing tool, consider if it's really worth it. Rather, you can always choose a much easier yet still powerful editor like Filmora to save your time for better editing.

I would recommend going with a multi-purpose tool like Filmora that will help you edit all kinds of videos and meet your post-production needs in one place.

**FAQ:**

1. Can I use Filmora to make high-quality changes to videos?

Filmora is an all-in-one video editor with many features and can do many things well. It makes professional video editing easy because it offers a user-friendly interface, drag-and-drop editing, and other complex video editing functions.

1. How well does Magix work?

Magix Movie Studio is an easy-to-use, stylish movie editor that doesn't cost too much. There are still some problems, like the reverse track order, but it's clear that this is a choice, and if you use other video editing programs, you'll get used to it.

1. Is Audacity good for the new learner?

Because it is so easy to use, Audacity is a great software for beginners who want to record and edit voices and recordings like a pro because it is so easy to use. Before we learn how to use Audacity step by step, let's look at some of the things that make it useful.

1. How long can Audacity record for?

Since Audacity stores samples as 64-bit values (even on 32-bit devices), there is no 32-bit rule that says recordings can't be longer than 231 samples (which is for example, just over 13.5 hours at a 44,100 Hz sample rate).

1. How do I change things in Apowersoft?

Use magic and fantasy to make your edits. To cut or crop a video file, click the scissors or cropping icon, depending on what you want to do. To join videos, drag files into the timeline in the order you want. Add filters and video overlay to your movie to make it look better.
