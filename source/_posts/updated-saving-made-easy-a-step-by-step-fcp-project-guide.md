Image from the Internet

The Face Swap makes switching faces with your friends in real-time look easy because you just have to start recording a video, and the app will do all the work for you. What’s more, you can use this app to swap faces in photos, so you can become your favorite celebrity in just a few seconds. The [lite version](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/face-swap-live-lite-switch/id1077478814?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8) of the app is also available if you don’t want to spend your money on this app until you’ve tried what it can do. However, the app’s file-sharing capabilities are far from perfect.

#### 9. Face Swap Booth

You can add your face over a single photo as many times as you want, swap faces across several photos, change faces with superstars, and much more if you decide to install this app on your Smartphone. The advanced face detection technology automatically switches the faces in all photos with utmost precision, so you can focus on discovering ways to make your images as entertaining as they can possibly be. The only downside is that you will have to upgrade to the premium version of the app in order to be able to use all of its features.

#### 10. MixBooth 4.0

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

Image from the Internet

Transform yourself into a movie star, your favorite singer, or any other famous person in just a few seconds. Using this app is really simple, because you just have to select a picture that contains a face you’d like to use as your own, and the app will automatically make the switch. MixBooth lets you take photos or import images from your photo library or even from your Facebook account. In order to see how the final image is going to look like, you just have to shake your phone, and if you like the result, you can save a photo to your phone or share it on a social media platform of your choice.

**Bonus**

Instead, if you would like to do it on PC, I highly recommend you to watch this clip.

**Conclusion**

We all enjoy a healthy dose of humor, and that’s exactly what face swap apps are offering. Becoming your friend or a superstar can be entertaining not just for you but for your followers on social media as well. Try one of the face swap apps we recommended in this article and make your accounts on social media even more entertaining. You can also record this funny face swap process and [edit the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with fun in Filmora video editor.
