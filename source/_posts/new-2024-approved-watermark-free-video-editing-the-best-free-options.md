### Q1\. Does Lightworks Free Version Have a Watermark?

No, the free version of Lightworks does not have a watermark. You can directly export videos to YouTube/Vimeo, but you are limited to the MPEG4/ format and a maximum resolution of 720p.

The advanced features such as user-definable project locations, Boris FX, Boris Graffiti, advanced Project sharing & Stereoscopic (3D) output are also missing in the free version. What's more, you need to "renew" the free license every seven days.

### Q2\. Does Free Movavi Have a Watermark?

Yes, all software from Movavi adds a "Trial" watermark to output videos when you use a trial/free version of the program. Trial versions come with a 7-day trial license (14-day for Movavi Business Suite).

They also come with certain restrictions that vary from program to program. The most common limitation is, that when converting audio files, only half the file length is converted. In the Movavi Video Suite trial, video capture is limited to 5 minutes & audio capture is 2 minutes.
