### 4\. Lightworks

Pulp Fiction, King’s Speech or LA Confidential are just a few among countless movie masterpieces that were edited in Lightworks. Even though the 32-bit version of this cross-platform video editing software can be downloaded for free, the recommended technical specifications can be overwhelming for most PC that have Windows 7 installed. You are going to need an Intel i7 or an AMD processor, at least 3GB of RAM and 2GB of free space in order for Lightworks to run on your computer smoothly.
