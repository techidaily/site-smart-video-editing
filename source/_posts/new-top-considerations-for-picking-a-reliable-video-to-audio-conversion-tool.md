Without the need for an in-house team or outsourcing your video brand awareness, it's quicker than ever to make high-quality films on your own. Here are some of the top picks.

### 1\. Windows Photos App

Microsoft Photos, a free digital viewer and video editor included with Windows 10 and Windows 11, provides capable visual effects and video enhancements, as well as techniques for organizing and editing videos, everything in a touch-friendly functionality. Windows 10/11 comes with the Photos app pre-integrated. You don't have to do anything to obtain the app when you have Windows 10/11.

The free Microsoft photo and video editing app is a great choice for viewing, editing, and sharing digital photos and videos. As the name suggests, it's for Windows users – a delight to use a picture and video-editing tool that's simple to use, clean, and has all the functions you need for basic viewing and repairs. Obviously, a full-featured program like the Windows Photos App is required for advanced photo organizing, optimization, and effects.

The Photos app features the Automatic Video tool which can [create video automatically with the images or videos uploaded](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

### 2\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

Okay, so this one won't actually apply to those of you who deal with computers, but we'd be negligent if we left it off the roster. Thanks to its high-class interface, it doesn't get much nicer than Apple iMovie regarding elegance and beauty. It is only supported by macOS and iOS.

The ten [high-fidelity filters in iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are among the best in the video editing game, and you can utilize AirDrop to instantly and smoothly transmit your video to your Mac when you're filming on your iPhone or working on your iPad.

Do you want to add "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" to the image? Because iMovie is integrated with iTunes and GarageBand, you may quickly add unique music and sounds to your movie. Once your video is finished, send it out into the world via iMessage, Facebook, YouTube, or any of iMovie's numerous easily accessible venues.

Here are some tips and tricks in editing videos with iMovie, hope that will help you edit faster.

### 3\. [Apple Photos App](https://www.apple.com/macos/photos/)

The interface of Apple Photos is clean, straightforward, and direct, allowing you to express yourself using basic, uncomplicated shortcuts rather than the complex layers of capabilities seen in more feature-rich products. It is only supported by Apple devices only.

Years, collections, and Moments are used to arrange the videos. Only current devices with 64-bit CPUs, such as the iPhone 5s or above, is compliant with the new release of Apple Photos. The Apple Photos mobile application includes thumbnail sliders to switch numerous characteristics of a photo quickly, in addition to options for auto-enhance, red-eye removal, and crop/rotate.
