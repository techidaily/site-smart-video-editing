So if you change the Editing mode to Custom and you set the resolution of a sequence to 7680 x 4320, Adobe Premiere Pro will allow you to export your video in the 8K resolution.

### 2\. Adobe Premiere Pro - for 8K video editing

**Price:** $20,99 per month as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Importing and editing 8K footage with Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2019 isn’t any different than editing videos captured in lower resolutions. However, this video editing software for Mac and PC computers **doesn’t let you choose the 8K resolution from its Export window**. That is why you must adjust a project’s resolution from the Sequence Settings window before you actually start manipulating the footage.

So if you change the Editing mode to Custom and you set the resolution of a sequence to 7680 x 4320, Adobe Premiere Pro will allow you to export your video in the 8K resolution.

Keep in mind that you must also change the codec to  from the Export Settings window in order to get the maximum video quality. Optionally, you can experiment with different export settings depending on the type of project you’re working on and the quality of the output file you would like to create.

Despite the fact that the process of creating 8K videos with Adobe Premiere Pro is a bit technical, this 8K video editing software is still one of the best options you can find on the market. Moreover, the video editing tools you’ll have at your disposal if you choose to edit your 8K videos with this video editing app are going to enable you to produce professional-looking videos.

Besides, you can now play up to three streams of 8K ProRes raw videos captured with RED and other professional cameras. These improvements enable you to import, process and export 8K videos much faster than ever before, which is the reason why Final Cut Pro X is currently one of the best, if not the best 8K video editing software for Mac computers.

You should keep in mind that you are going to need at least 8 GB and preferably more of RAM and lots of storage space if you are planning on editing 8K footage with Final Cut Pro X on a constant basis. [Using proxies](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can make the process of editing 8K video files much faster, but you are still going to need a hard-drive where you can keep all of your high-resolution materials.

Before you open Cloud Stop Motion and start clicking pictures of your subject for your video, it is important to have a story in mind. So, create a storyboard to break down your stop motion video.

It will help you create your project efficiently, ensuring that you have taken pictures of all the frames that you need to tell your story.

![adding new project on cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/adding-new-project-on-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

Tip: Keeping your phone or camera steady while making your stop-motion project is the key. You can use a tripod, a selfie stick, or a gimbal to keep your device as still as possible.

Cloud Stop Motion is a great browser-based app that one can use to create fun animation videos. You can use Cloud Stop Motion even when you have not created your account. But consider creating an account to enjoy additional features.

![cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

Before you open Cloud Stop Motion and start clicking pictures of your subject for your video, it is important to have a story in mind. So, create a storyboard to break down your stop motion video. You can sketch your plan frame by frame or write bulleted list of your frames. It will help you create your project efficiently, ensuring that you have taken pictures of all the frames that you need to tell your story.

![adding new project on cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/adding-new-project-on-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

Step 1: Once you have created your storyboard, open the app to go to the Cloud Stop Motion dashboard. Click on the new project button. Cloud Stop Motion needs access to your camera for capturing images. So, allow camera access.

![allowing access to camera on cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/allowing-access-to-camera-on-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

On the dashboard, go to the taking picture menu. Now place the subject at the center of your frame. Capture a few test shots to find the composition that you like. You can see the picture at the bottom of the timeline. If needed, adjust the position of your subject. Make sure that the location you choose has plenty of light. If not, you also use a lamp for good light.

Tip: Keeping your phone or camera steady while making your stop-motion project is the key. You can use a tripod, a selfie stick, or a gimbal to keep your device as still as possible. If you don't own any of these, keep your device on something sturdy and make sure that you do not change its place until you capture all the images needed for your project. This way all your shots will be consistent.

Step 2: Move your subject or change its position and take a picture. Repeat the process until you complete your story. To make your stop-motion smooth, make small changes to the position of your subject between shots.

You can also add more frames per second. Generally, you should add 10 frames per second. But you can go for 25 frames per second to make a smoother video. All the pictures you snap are automatically added to the editor in chronological order.

Step 3: Once you have captured images for your project, add sound by going to the sound menu in the top left of the dashboard. You can record sounds, upload sounds, or select sounds from Cloud Stop Motion's gallery. You can also add text to your Cloud Stop Motion project if you want.

Step 4: Click on play button to preview your project and see if your motion picture turned out as per your liking or not. If you do not like something, go back and make changes. Once done, download your video from cloudstop motion.
