The best way to animate a 3D object is by using keyframes and built-in templates. As a beginner, you may not know how to make a 3D object, but with templates, you just need to choose one and start customizing it.

### 3\. Where can I animate for free?

There are so many free-to-use animation software to use. Pencil2D is a reliable tool to make animation easy. You just need to download it on the desktop to animate objects. However, it'd be best if you have a basic understanding of how to make animation. Otherwise, you may need some time to learn it first.

## Part 3: How to Make Stop Motion Videos from Videos Online

In case you don’t have the photos you can use to create a stop motion animation, platforms like Kapwing allow you to turn a regular video into a stop motion video. All you need to do is upload a video clip from your computer or via a URL to Kapwing and the platform will automatically generate a stop motion video. One of the best part is that Kapwing also provides a sample if you don’t want to upload your own footage.

![    Import footage to Kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-stop-motion-footage-in-kapwing.jpg)

![ kapwing stop motion maker interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker.jpg)

While adjusting these settings you should keep in mind that lowering a [video’s frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) too much can result in choppy footage and uneven movement of the objects in the stop motion video you’re creating.

Kapwing also offers the option to [play the video in reverse](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), but finding the right context to use this feature can prove to be a challenging task. Click on the Create button when ready to export the stop motion video and wait for the platform to generate the video.

![ kapwing stop motion maker export & share](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker-export.jpg)

Afterward, you can choose to download, edit or share the video on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter. In case you created a stop motion video while you were logged out of your Kapwing account, the platform will add a watermark to it, and you must sign in to [remove](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) it.

**Conclusion**

**Pros**

* No payment required prior to installation
* Equipped with audio recording tools
* Enables users to upload their own footage
* Videos are saved in WebM format

**Cons**

* The extension is prone to crashes
* No video editing options

Anyone can create stop motion animations with this web-based app, even if they don’t have any previous video editing experience. However, before you can start creating using Cloud Stop Motion you must first create an account and grant the app access to your computer’s webcam. Afterward, you just have to start a new project and start snapping pictures.

Each image you take will be displayed on the timeline so that you can have a clear overview of all photos that are going to be included in the stop motion video. Cloud Stop Motion lets you record audio and import audio files from its sound library or your computer.

After the upload process is completed you can rearrange images, upload an audio file that will be used as the soundtrack and choose how many images are going to be displayed on the screen each second. Optionally, you can also [add your logo](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to the stop motion video and adjust its size and on-screen position. After the platform generates the video from your photos you can download it to your computer, but you will not be able to share it on social media directly from the platform.

## Part 2: How to Make Stop Motion Video from Photos Online

Stop motion videos are composed of sequences of still images that create the illusion that the object in the shots are moving. The Cloud Stop Motion app offers a free and easy way to make stop motion animations directly from the web-browser using the [web camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

After you sign in to your account on this platform, you should click on the New Project option that is located in the Projects tab.

![ Create Stop Motion with Captured Photos  - create project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-project-in-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

Once the Animation window loads, you will be able to see the timeline below the preview window that shows everything your web camera can see. After you composed your shot, you should simply click on the Camera button that is located on the right side of the screen, then move the object that is in the shot and click on the camera button again. You should repeat this process as many times as necessary until you have captured all the frames you want to include in your stop motion animation.

![ Capture Photos in  Cloud Stop Motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capture-photos-with-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

In case you want to alter the frame rate, you can click on the Project Settings icon that is located at the top of the toolbar in the upper left corner of the screen.

![ Cloud Stop Motion Project Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cloud-stop-motion-project-settings.jpg)

Clicking on the Audio icon will grant you access to the Cloud Stop Motion’s [sound library](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that contains hundreds of songs and audio effects. What’s more, you can also record voiceovers with this online stop motion maker, although you must first give the app permission to access your computer’s microphone.

![    Cloud Stop Motion Audio Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cloud-stop-motion-audio-library.jpg)

Cloud Stop Motion is equipped with fully customizable title, credit, speech bubble, and chapter heading templates and you just have to click on them to add them to a project.

![    Cloud Stop Motion Titles Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cloud-stop-motion-insert-titles.jpg)

Click on the Export button, after you complete all work on a project and proceed to choose the video’s aspect ratio or its export size. Keep in mind that changing a stop motion video’s output format is not possible since you can only [create MP4 videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with Cloud Stop Motion.

![    Cloud Stop Motion Export Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cloud-stop-motion-export-options.jpg)

All projects are automatically saved and they can be accessed every time you sign in to your account on Cloud Stop Motion, which enables you to create different versions of the same stop motion videos.

## Part 3: How to Make Stop Motion Videos from Videos Online

In case you don’t have the photos you can use to create a stop motion animation, platforms like Kapwing allow you to turn a regular video into a stop motion video. All you need to do is upload a video clip from your computer or via a URL to Kapwing and the platform will automatically generate a stop motion video. One of the best part is that Kapwing also provides a sample if you don’t want to upload your own footage.

![    Import footage to Kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-stop-motion-footage-in-kapwing.jpg)

After the upload process is completed a new window will load where you can choose the speed at which frames are displayed on the screen and pick the rate at which frames are taken from the source video.

![ kapwing stop motion maker interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker.jpg)

While adjusting these settings you should keep in mind that lowering a [video’s frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) too much can result in choppy footage and uneven movement of the objects in the stop motion video you’re creating.

Kapwing also offers the option to [play the video in reverse](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), but finding the right context to use this feature can prove to be a challenging task. Click on the Create button when ready to export the stop motion video and wait for the platform to generate the video.

![ kapwing stop motion maker export & share](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker-export.jpg)

Afterward, you can choose to download, edit or share the video on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter. In case you created a stop motion video while you were logged out of your Kapwing account, the platform will add a watermark to it, and you must sign in to [remove](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) it.

**Conclusion**

Finding ways to produce content that stands out on social media is becoming increasingly difficult as video content is growing more popular. Online stop motion makers provide a simple way to use photos and videos to create attention-grabbing videos.
