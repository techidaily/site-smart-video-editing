Besides enhancing the photos you take with your Smartphone or your DSLR camera, you can use [photo editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to produce images that don’t look realistic. Cartooning a photo is one out of many options nearly all desktop-based photo editors offer, although in most cases you will have to combine several effects in order to cartoon your pictures.
