**1\. How to edit a vertical video?**

Editing a vertical video is not much different than editing a horizontal video, as you need to remove the parts of the footage you don’t want to include in your project, enhance the colors in a video or add transitions between shots.

**2\. How to change the video’s orientation from horizontal to vertical in iMovie?**

Rotating a video in iMovie is a simple task that can be completed with a single tap. You just have to select a clip you want to rotate on the timeline and then go to the Crop window and rotate your video for 90-degrees.

**1\. How to edit a vertical video?**

Editing a vertical video is not much different than editing a horizontal video, as you need to remove the parts of the footage you don’t want to include in your project, enhance the colors in a video or add transitions between shots.

**2\. How to change the video’s orientation from horizontal to vertical in iMovie?**

Rotating a video in iMovie is a simple task that can be completed with a single tap. You just have to select a clip you want to rotate on the timeline and then go to the Crop window and rotate your video for 90-degrees.

---

#### **Conclusion**

Finding a video editing app that is compatible with the iOS or Android operating system that allows you to create vertical videos shouldn’t be too difficult, as there are so many different options on the market. What’s more, some of the vertical video apps can also be used to capture the footage you want to share on social media.
