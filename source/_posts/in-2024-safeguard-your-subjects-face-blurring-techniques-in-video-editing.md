#### 3. Blur Face with Movavi video editor

**Movavi** is a popular choice for when it comes to free video editing softwares. It is available for both **Windows** and **MacOS** and is a breeze to work in - the perfect software to learn how to blur the faces in videos in.

[**How to Blur the Faces with Movavi video editor**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**:**

* Open **Movavi** and locate the **Filters**
* Click **Blur**.

![ blur faces](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-face-with-movavi-video-editor.jpg)

* Once the filter gallery opens, **drag your desired filter** over the clip or image.
* You can apply either the **Blur Intense** or the **Blur Mild** effects if you would like to determine their strength.
* In order to blur a specific part of the video, select the clip and locate the **More**
* Click **Highlight and Conceal**, and then click **Conceal**.
* **Position** the orange box over the area that you want to be affected.
* You can adjust the **Opacity** slider to determne the strength of the effect.
* Click on **Pixels** if you want the blur preset to be pixellated.
* You can also click on **Add Mask** if you would like to apply a mask to certain areas of the clip.

#### 4. Blur face with Adobe Premiere Pro CC professional video editor

**Premiere Pro CC** is Adobe’s dedicated video editing software. There are many video editors out there that have some experience in Photoshop as well, and since there’s a chance they work in Premiere Pro CC due to how similar the UI of both of these products is, we’ve decided to give this NLE some attention as well. Available for both **MacOS** and **Windows**.

**How to Blur the Faces in Premiere Pro?**

1. **Select** the video clip in the timeline.
2. Access the **Effects** tab, and then click **Video Effects,** and then **Stylize**.
3. Click **Mosaic**.
4. Go to the **Effects Control** tab, and pick the shape of blurred area. The elliptical and 4-point polygon mask options are what most people use when blurring faces in particular.
5. Drag the **Mask** over the intended area
6. Adjust **Positioning**, **Scale**, **and**/**or Rotation** to your liking.
7. You can fine-tune the effect further by adjusting the **Mask Expansion,** the **Horizontal and Vertical** blocks the mosaic effect is composed of, and the **Feather**

What sort of video editing software you go for when you want to edit the face in videos is ultimately up to you - we’ve only expressed our personal preferences in the hopes that it might help some of the people that are interested in the subject. Most of the steps present in this list are similar to each other and you will find that once you learn how to do this trick, you will become far more familiarized with all the various effects available to you.

## 10\. Avidemux

[Avidemux](http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/) is a **free video editor** for Windows, Mac, and Linux that doesn't aim to be a full-fledged timeline-based video editing software. Rather, it's made to make a few minor modifications and then splits out a new file.

You may import your source video and pick the start and finish frames to chop off segments. You may add filters to enhance the video by sharpening the picture or decreasing noise.

Some of the aesthetic options include color effects and borders, while others enhance the clip by sharpening the image or reducing noise. You may even add other clips to the end of your existing one, although this type of work would be better suited to a complete non-linear editor.

If you don't need to make any changes to the video, Avidemux may come in handy; as part of its exporting process, it allows you to do so.

**Pros**

* Decent aesthetic options for video editing
* Edit multiple videos at the same time
* Multiple stickers to add to your videos

**Cons**

* Lags sometimes
