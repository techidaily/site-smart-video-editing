## Part 4: Tips That Are Going to Help You Make a Better Video Resume

Creating your first video resume can be an intimidating task, so here are a few tips that will help you go through the process smoothly.

**Relax, you can always do another take –** Don’t panic if at first, you have a tough time remembering your lines. Just relax, because the shot is going to look much better if you act naturally.

**Less is more –** Respect the time of your potential employers by keeping your video resume short. Video resumes that last between one and two minutes often produce the best results.

**Don’t improvise, make a script –** Put your ideas on paper, that will make them much easier to remember once the camera starts rolling.

**Focus on what you’re good at –** You have a limited amount of time to explain why you are the right candidate for the job, don’t waste that time on talking about your weaknesses.

**Don’t forget your audience –** Try to understand what the people who are going to watch the video like and what they don’t like. If you manage to do this, your video resume is going to grab the attention of its viewers.

## Part 4: Tips That Are Going to Help You Make a Better Video Resume

Creating your first video resume can be an intimidating task, so here are a few tips that will help you go through the process smoothly.

**Relax, you can always do another take –** Don’t panic if at first, you have a tough time remembering your lines. Just relax, because the shot is going to look much better if you act naturally.

**Less is more –** Respect the time of your potential employers by keeping your video resume short. Video resumes that last between one and two minutes often produce the best results.

**Don’t improvise, make a script –** Put your ideas on paper, that will make them much easier to remember once the camera starts rolling.

**Focus on what you’re good at –** You have a limited amount of time to explain why you are the right candidate for the job, don’t waste that time on talking about your weaknesses.

**Don’t forget your audience –** Try to understand what the people who are going to watch the video like and what they don’t like. If you manage to do this, your video resume is going to grab the attention of its viewers.

1. Which is better: Windows Movie Maker or iMovie?

Reviewers looked at both options and found that Windows Movie Maker was easier to use. However, iMovie is easier to set up and use. Overall, people who reviewed iMovie said they liked working with it. Reviewers thought that iMovie was better for their business needs than Windows Movie Maker.

1. Is using iMovie on Windows a smart idea?

Can I use iMovie on a Windows computer? It can only be used on iOS and macOS. On a Windows PC, you can run some alternatives. For Windows, MiniTool Movie Maker is a fantastic video editor. With it, it's simple to edit video, split or trim it, add animated text, and carry out other operations.

1. Comparison between Final Cut Pro and iMovie.

Since its files are smaller and have fewer tools, iMovie works faster than Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro has a wide range of cutting-edge features because it was made mostly for professional editors. On the other hand, iMovie has fewer features and editing tools for people who are just starting.

1. Is Final Cut Pro challenging to learn?

You might find the interface of Final Cut Pro a little intimidating if you've used other video editing programs like iMovie. Don't worry. Learning the basic editing skills, you'll use for 90% of your work with Final Cut Pro takes a few minutes.
