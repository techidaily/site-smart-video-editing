Ezvid is primarily a screen capturing software that also offers a decent amount of video editing options. It is a great choice if you want to record video games you play or create tutorials, as you can easily define the area of the screen youâ€™d like to capture and record all on-screen movement. The Voice Synthesis feature lets you create narration quickly, while text overlays or screen drawing options can help you highlight the most important parts of the video. Ezvid doesnâ€™t support a lot of different video file formats, which can limit your choices during the video editing process.

The Remix feature lets you combine photos and videos into a single file instantly, and it can be quite useful if youâ€™re just looking for a way to quickly make a video.
