### 2\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)\[Beginners\]

Apple native iMovie is a simple and basic video editing tool that can well compete with the likes of VLLO. But there is a good reason to mention the application as the second in the list next to Filmora for Mac. And the reason: it is not as powerful, intuitive as Filmora for Mac. Mind you, iMovie includes all the basic features needed for everyday video editing. You can cut, split, trim, and apply filters, effects, and more. However, for the sake of the simple interface — Apple excluded important features like Timeline panel from the interface, giving you less control over the videos.

In all, the application is suitable for the users who do not need powerful editing features or take much control of what’s happening in the video. Still, given the fact that the application is free to utilize, it does not hurt to download the application and verify whether the application will suit your needs or not.

But if you are serious about video editing or want to edit videos like a professional by tailoring every detail exactly like you want - Filmora for Mac is the way to go!

_“Is Dubsmash still good? What are some other dub apps like it that I can use?”_

With the availability of so many **video dubbing apps**, users have become a little confused about their features. These days, a lot of friends ask me about the best dub app that they can use. Ideally, the selection of a preferred dubbing app would depend on your requirements. Some apps have better editing features while others are more social. Therefore, to help you pick [the most appropriate video dubbing app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for your needs, I have decided to come up with this list.

* [Part 1: Top 6 Video Dubbing Mobile Apps](#part1)
* [Part 2: How to Pick Up the Best Dubbing App?](#part2)

## Top 6 Video Dubbing Mobile Apps

While there are tons of video dubbing and social apps out there, I would say the following tried-and-tested options are the best.

#### 1\. [Dubsmash](https://dubsmash.com/)

Dubsmash is often considered as the original dub app as it has been around for years. You can find tons of existing voiceovers and can instantly share your videos with your friends via its social feature.

* There are thousands of voiceovers you can find listed under different categories.
* You can just select any voiceover audio and start lip-syncing it while recording your video.
* Not just to record videos, the app can also be used to watch tons of memes and funny videos.
* There is an inbuilt option to further edit the video like clip it, apply a filter, and so on.

**Pros**

* Free and easy to use
* Has a social community

**Cons**

* Not so secure (witnessed data breach issues in the past)

**Runs on**: iOS and Android

#### 2\. [MadLipz](https://madlipz.com/)

Known for its “instant dubbing and subbing” features, this dub app is already used by millions of people worldwide. The video dubbing app runs on iOS and Android and is available in different languages as well.

* There are tons of ready-made clips and recordings in different categories to pick from.
