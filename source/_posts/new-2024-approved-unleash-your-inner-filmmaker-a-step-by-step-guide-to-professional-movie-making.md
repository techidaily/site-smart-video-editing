To edit and enhance videos in Windows-based PC, Windows Movie Maker has always been touted as the default Microsoft Video Editor, although it has been discontinued by Microsoft on Janauary 10, 2017 and replaced by [Windows Story Remix (only for Windows 8/10)](https://www.howtogeek.com/355524/how-to-use-windows-10s-hidden-video-editor/), you can still download it on many platforms. However, you may often fail to import their video clips because it only supports WMV ASF, .MPG (MPEG-1), .AVI (DV-AVI), .WMA, .WAV, and .MP3\.
