## Part 1: Recommended Desktop Video Editing Software for Android Videos

On an Android phone, editing videos can be a bit difficult due to the restrictions of the screen. [Editing your video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with the applications running on your Android devices is certainly rather convenient, but the cons are that they are usually quite limited when it comes to functions and features. It is highly recommended you try [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a desktop-based software that supports directly importing videos from your Android phone. All you need is to plug in a USB and let the program detects video files located in your Android phone, and then import them to the program for editing.

Check our [video tutorial guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to learn the detailed tricks of editing videos with Filmora.

Filmora’s reign as the king of video editors for beginners could be the abundant editing features it offers. With all basic video editing functions such as trimming, splitting, adding music, texts, voice-overs, etc. Filmora also comes with many advanced editing functions such as **green screen, speed ramping, auto beat maker,** video overlay, transition, mosaic, tilt-shift, jump cut, and dozens more.

What's more, you can stabilize your shaky video footage with the built-in Video Stabilization function. **With 300+ fancy visual effects from Filmstocks, NewBlue, and Boris,** and an array of other funny tools, it offers you an intuitive interface to help create and share your created home movie in a much easier way. After finishing editing, you can save the video to your Android smartphone, iPhone, or iPad, or directly upload the video to your Facebook, YouTube, or Vimeo to share with your family and friends, or burn it to the DVD collection.
