![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Cartooning a photo is a simple and yet effective way of enhancing a picture and making it more visually appealing. Besides adding an artistic touch to portraits you take, cartooning a photo can also be a great way to have fun with your friends because the results of picture cartooning can be as entertaining as visually striking.

Besides portraiture, this visual effect can be applied to virtually any other genre of photography, although the contents of the shoot usually determine how well the effect is going to work. What’s more, you don’t need a [professional video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to cartoon a photo, since there are so many websites that let you apply this effect to your photos for free.

That’s why we selected some of the best websites for converting a photo into a cartoon.

## 10+ Best Online Cartoon Photo Makers

[Making cartoons](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) out of photos doesn’t have to be a difficult task that takes a lot of effort to complete. In fact, online cartoon photo makers are easy to use and they don’t require you to have a lot of photo editing experience.

We’ve selected some of the [best online photo editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and photo converters that enable you to cartoon your photos in just a few clicks.

### Part 1: Best Free Online Cartoon Photo Editors

You don’t have to purchase an expensive photo editing software if you want to cartoon your photos because there are so many different online photo editing platforms that allow you to apply this effect to your photos for free. Let’s take a closer look at what they have to offer.

#### 2. BeFunky

Befunky is one of the best photo editors you can find online, which is why it is hardly surprising that it offers cartoonization effects. In fact, you can choose from **five different cartoonization effects** that are all equally impressive.

All of the cartoon effects Befunky has to offer are located in the Artsy menu, and you just have to click on Cartoonizer DLX, Cross Hatch DLX, Pop Art DLX, or Graphic Novel DLX effects in order to apply them to your photo. Furthermore, you can use the Erase mode if you don’t want to catoonize the entire photo or head over to the Adjust menu to specify the amount of the effect you’ll apply and increase or decrease the photo’s sharpness.

Go to <https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/> and you can then turn your photos to cartoon easily in BeFunky.

#### 3. Lunapic

This is yet another online photo editing platform that gives you access to a broad range of photo editing options for free. Even though a bit outdated, the Lunapic’s interface resembles Photoshop’s interface, so you won’t need much time to get used to it if you ever used Adobe’s iconic photo editing software.

Once you’ve uploaded a photo, you just have to go to the Effects menu and select the Cartoon option. Lunapic will then automatically apply the effect to the photo you uploaded and you just need to preview the image before you save it. The only downside is that you can’t adjust the effect’s settings in case you don’t like the results.

If you want to add cartoon effect to photo with this photo editor, you can go to <https://www12.lunapic.com/editor/?action=cartoon>.

#### 4. wish2be cartoon photo editor

If you would like to [turn yourself or your friends into a cartoon character](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Wish2Be cartoon photo editor can be a fun option. The platform’s Free Caricature feature allows you to become a cartoon character in just three easy steps.

You start by customizing the background, selecting the body type, hairstyle, or adding different accessories, gadgets, or even weapons. Once you are done, you can proceed to upload a photo of the person you want to turn into a cartoon character. Optionally, you can add a text layer and adjust its position and size within the picture. If you like the caricature you created, you can buy a print or you can choose to share your design for free. The Pro Cartoonizer feature this platform offers is only available if you purchase one of the available subscription plans.

Here is the website <https://www.wish2be.com/app/cartoon-photo-editor/> for cartoon photos with Wish2Be.

#### 5. SnapsTouch

This is a simple online photo editor that lets you turn your photos into sketches, paintings, or drawings. Choosing the Painting option is probably the easiest way to turn a photo into a cartoon, although this effect can also be achieved with the Pencil Sketch feature.

After you upload a photo you want to turn into a cartoon, you can choose between Painting 1 and Painting 2 options in order to determine the style of the cartoon you’re creating. In addition, you can decide if you want to include the outline in the painting as well as set the size of the brush and how many levels the final image should have.

### Part 1: Best Free Online Cartoon Photo Editors

You don’t have to purchase an expensive photo editing software if you want to cartoon your photos because there are so many different online photo editing platforms that allow you to apply this effect to your photos for free. Let’s take a closer look at what they have to offer.

#### 2. BeFunky

Befunky is one of the best photo editors you can find online, which is why it is hardly surprising that it offers cartoonization effects. In fact, you can choose from **five different cartoonization effects** that are all equally impressive.

All of the cartoon effects Befunky has to offer are located in the Artsy menu, and you just have to click on Cartoonizer DLX, Cross Hatch DLX, Pop Art DLX, or Graphic Novel DLX effects in order to apply them to your photo. Furthermore, you can use the Erase mode if you don’t want to catoonize the entire photo or head over to the Adjust menu to specify the amount of the effect you’ll apply and increase or decrease the photo’s sharpness.

Go to <https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/> and you can then turn your photos to cartoon easily in BeFunky.

Once you’ve uploaded a photo, you just have to go to the Effects menu and select the Cartoon option. Lunapic will then automatically apply the effect to the photo you uploaded and you just need to preview the image before you save it. The only downside is that you can’t adjust the effect’s settings in case you don’t like the results.

### 04**X2Convert**

X2 Convert, accordingly, works the same way. It's a **Facebook Audio Converter** that you can use pretty much at any time (for free, no installation or download required.) Just visit the URL provided, paste the link of the video that you want to download, and go!

![X2Convert Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2012.png)

### 05**Youtube 4K Downloader**

The YouTube 4K Downloader tool, despite its name, works as well as your average **Facebook MP3 converter**! As you can see in the image below, they have an option specifically for converting Facebook videos into MP3s!

## Part 4 **Top 8 Facebook Mp3 Converter Online**

For this next section, we've gathered up a couple of other **Facebook MP3 Converter**s that you can use! This time, however, we've also attached a Youtube video from which you can learn how to use said converter! And, even more importantly, we've varied things up a bit — including not just online converters, but also plug-ins and software.

### 01**Getfvid**

Getfvid makes it to the top of our list for its sheer popularity! This is the **Facebook MP3 converter** that many people defaulted to. It is, after all, an completely FREE video converter. And, just like the other Facebook video downloaders, we introduced in the previous section, it's pretty easy to use as well!

### 02**Online Video Converter**

Online Video Converter is another online conversion tool that you might want to consider. Compared to some of the other online converters out there, it is packed with lots of features (allowing you to download Facebook audio but also audio from many other social media platforms and websites. Plus, converting in a variety of formats!)

### 03**AceThinker**

AceThinker makes our third online **Facebook MP3 converter** on this list. It works just like the rest and offers a couple of extra features on top of that (which includes multiple formats for conversions and, also, the ability to download and convert videos to audio from other sites.)

### 04**Wondershare Filmora**

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is the first and only **Facebook MP3 Converter** software on this list! It will require download and installation. And, it's a freemium tool as well. So, you'll have to keep that in mind. However, unlike every other **Facebook audio converter** on this list, it comes with advanced video editing features that will allow you to actually put the audio that you downloaded to use (be it for a special video message, a professional presentation, a fun party video, and so on.)

For macOS 10.12 or later

### 05**Flash Video Downloader (Plug-In)**

The next **Facebook audio converter** is also different from the norm! After all, it's a plug-in! More specifically, it's a chrome extension that you can download (for free) from the Chrome web store and install into your browser! It's obviously a lot different from the other converters that we've introduced thus far, but it works just as well! If you want to learn more, check out the YouTube video, where the process is explained in more detail.

### 06**Video Downloader Professional (Plug-In)**

Next, we have another chrome extension in the form of 'Video Downloader Professional'! This plug-in, just like the previous one, is available for Chrome browsers and you can use it to download media (including Facebook audio) whenever you want.

### 07**Stream Recorder (Plug-In)**

Stream Recorder is our third and final chrome extension in this list! This one is a bit different though! Mainly because, rather than instantly downloading media, you have to turn it on and let the media play (in order to record it!) It's mainly used for recording live streams (but it works on Facebook, so you can use it as a **Facebook audio converter** if that is what you need.)

### 08**Apowersoft**

With Apowersoft, we go back to the most common type of online converter! It's the perfect place to round us off. After all, it is very similar to the other converters we introduced in the beginning!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Need a way of converting a Facebook video into an audio file? Well, then you don't have to worry anymore! Hopefully, the tutorials we've provided will be able to help you on your quest!

**●** There are plenty of online Facebook MP3 converters that you can use for this!

![Use Online Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%208.png)

## Part 3 **Best 5 Facebook Mp3 Downloader Online**

Finally, we've gotten to the part where we introduce all the best **Facebook Audio Converter** websites available! These are all online tools that you can visit and use (in much the same way described in the two tutorials above) in order to turn your Facebook video into an MP3!

### 01**Facebook Video Downloader**

Facebook Video Downloader is the first of the **Facebook MP3 Converters** on this list. The URL for it has been provided below! And, as you can see from the image provided, you can use it by pasting the direct URL of the Facebook video that you want to convert and then pressing the 'Download' button! The best part of it is that it has several conversation formats (both for audio and video conversion), including, of course, **Facebook to MP3 Converter (free!)**

![Facebook Video Downloader - Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%209.png)

### 02**MP3Conv**

MP3Conv is another online **Facebook MP3 Converter** that you can use 100% for free. Furthermore, it also works for other sites (including, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit!) The process for using this tool is pretty much the same way as all the rest as well. Just past and click 'Download' to finish!

![MP3CONV Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2010.png)

### 03**O Downloader**

The O-Downloader (Facebook Downloader) is simpler than the previous two that we introduced. For one, it can only convert videos from Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram. Its conversion options are also limited to MP3 and MP4! However, aside from those differences, you use it pretty much how you would use any online video converter — paste the link and click 'Download'!

![Facebook Post Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%205.png)

**Step 2: Copy Facebook Video URL!**

Next, select the "Copy Link" option of the Facebook video that you want to download and convert!

![Facebook Post - Copy Link](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%206.png)

**Step 3: Use Facebook Video Converter!**

Next, paste the URL of the Facebook video onto your chosen Facebook Video Converter (as is shown in the image below!)

![Use Facebook Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%207.png)

**Step 4: Use MP4 to MP3 Converter!**

Once you've had your Facebook video converted into an MP4, all you need to do is upload that MP4 files to a free converter (like the one shown in the image below, URL provided!) In this way, you achieve Facebook to MP3 conversion!

## Part 3 **Best 5 Facebook Mp3 Downloader Online**

Finally, we've gotten to the part where we introduce all the best **Facebook Audio Converter** websites available! These are all online tools that you can visit and use (in much the same way described in the two tutorials above) in order to turn your Facebook video into an MP3!

### 01**Facebook Video Downloader**

Facebook Video Downloader is the first of the **Facebook MP3 Converters** on this list. The URL for it has been provided below! And, as you can see from the image provided, you can use it by pasting the direct URL of the Facebook video that you want to convert and then pressing the 'Download' button! The best part of it is that it has several conversation formats (both for audio and video conversion), including, of course, **Facebook to MP3 Converter (free!)**

![Facebook Video Downloader - Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%209.png)

### 02**MP3Conv**

MP3Conv is another online **Facebook MP3 Converter** that you can use 100% for free. Furthermore, it also works for other sites (including, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit!) The process for using this tool is pretty much the same way as all the rest as well. Just past and click 'Download' to finish!

![MP3CONV Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2010.png)

### 03**O Downloader**

The O-Downloader (Facebook Downloader) is simpler than the previous two that we introduced. For one, it can only convert videos from Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram. Its conversion options are also limited to MP3 and MP4! However, aside from those differences, you use it pretty much how you would use any online video converter — paste the link and click 'Download'!

![O-Downloader Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2011.png)

### 04**X2Convert**

X2 Convert, accordingly, works the same way. It's a **Facebook Audio Converter** that you can use pretty much at any time (for free, no installation or download required.) Just visit the URL provided, paste the link of the video that you want to download, and go!

![X2Convert Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2012.png)

### 05**Youtube 4K Downloader**

The YouTube 4K Downloader tool, despite its name, works as well as your average **Facebook MP3 converter**! As you can see in the image below, they have an option specifically for converting Facebook videos into MP3s!

![Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2013.png)

## Part 4 **Top 8 Facebook Mp3 Converter Online**

For this next section, we've gathered up a couple of other **Facebook MP3 Converter**s that you can use! This time, however, we've also attached a Youtube video from which you can learn how to use said converter! And, even more importantly, we've varied things up a bit — including not just online converters, but also plug-ins and software.

### 01**Getfvid**

Getfvid makes it to the top of our list for its sheer popularity! This is the **Facebook MP3 converter** that many people defaulted to. It is, after all, an completely FREE video converter. And, just like the other Facebook video downloaders, we introduced in the previous section, it's pretty easy to use as well!

### 02**Online Video Converter**

Online Video Converter is another online conversion tool that you might want to consider. Compared to some of the other online converters out there, it is packed with lots of features (allowing you to download Facebook audio but also audio from many other social media platforms and websites. Plus, converting in a variety of formats!)

### 03**AceThinker**

AceThinker makes our third online **Facebook MP3 converter** on this list. It works just like the rest and offers a couple of extra features on top of that (which includes multiple formats for conversions and, also, the ability to download and convert videos to audio from other sites.)

### 04**Wondershare Filmora**

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is the first and only **Facebook MP3 Converter** software on this list! It will require download and installation. And, it's a freemium tool as well. So, you'll have to keep that in mind. However, unlike every other **Facebook audio converter** on this list, it comes with advanced video editing features that will allow you to actually put the audio that you downloaded to use (be it for a special video message, a professional presentation, a fun party video, and so on.)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.12 or later

### 05**Flash Video Downloader (Plug-In)**

The next **Facebook audio converter** is also different from the norm! After all, it's a plug-in! More specifically, it's a chrome extension that you can download (for free) from the Chrome web store and install into your browser! It's obviously a lot different from the other converters that we've introduced thus far, but it works just as well! If you want to learn more, check out the YouTube video, where the process is explained in more detail.

### 06**Video Downloader Professional (Plug-In)**

Next, we have another chrome extension in the form of 'Video Downloader Professional'! This plug-in, just like the previous one, is available for Chrome browsers and you can use it to download media (including Facebook audio) whenever you want.

### 07**Stream Recorder (Plug-In)**

Stream Recorder is our third and final chrome extension in this list! This one is a bit different though! Mainly because, rather than instantly downloading media, you have to turn it on and let the media play (in order to record it!) It's mainly used for recording live streams (but it works on Facebook, so you can use it as a **Facebook audio converter** if that is what you need.)

### 08**Apowersoft**

With Apowersoft, we go back to the most common type of online converter! It's the perfect place to round us off. After all, it is very similar to the other converters we introduced in the beginning!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Need a way of converting a Facebook video into an audio file? Well, then you don't have to worry anymore! Hopefully, the tutorials we've provided will be able to help you on your quest!

**●** There are plenty of online Facebook MP3 converters that you can use for this!

**●** Don't hesitate to try out other types of tools as well! Including software, like Filmora Pro, or the chrome extensions that we introduced.
