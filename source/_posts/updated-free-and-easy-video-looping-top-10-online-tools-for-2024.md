## MPEG2 Video Compression Made Easy with VirtualDub

# Download VirtualDub MPEG2 & Use to Compress MPEG2 Videos

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

VirtualDub is a free video capture/processing tool for Windows platforms (2000/XP/Vista/7). And VirtualDub MPEG-2 is a modified version of VirtualDub that supports MPEG-2 import originally. However, just as the author said "This software is obsolete and will no longer be updated. For MPEG-2 and WMV support in the latest VirtualDub, try my plugins (MPEG-2 plugin for VirtualDub 1.8.1 or above - by editor)".

## Download and Install VirtualDub MPEG-2

You could [download VirtualDub MPEG-2](http://www.videohelp.com/download/VirtualDub-MPEG224586%20.zip?r=LcPXQgGCmNps) here and extract files to a folder. Now you get a video processing software with MPEG-2 video import supported. To run VirtualDub MPEG-2, double click the VirtualDub.exe.

## How to Use VirtualDub MPEG-2 to Compress Large MPEG-2 Videos

VirtualDub-MPEG2 is designed to work with mpeg2 video, such as Digital TV shows, un-encrypted DVD files (\*.vob) and these video files are usually in big size. Now you can compress them using VirtualDub MPEG-2.

### Step 1: Set Up Video Compression

Open your MPEG-2 video file through File/Open video file..., then go to Video/Compression to bring up the following dialog.

![virtualdub mpeg2](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/virtualdub-video-compression.jpg)

As shown above, select the XVID MPEG-4 codec and click Configure button to make Xvid settings.

![virtualdub mepg2 tutorial](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/virtualdub-mpeg2-compress.jpg)

**Note**: If Compression is disable, switch to Full processing mode first in the Video menu.

### Step 2: Set Up Audio Compression

Audio compression setup is similar to video compression, go to Audio/Full processing mode, and again Audio/Compression to open the dialog, where MPEG Layer-3 is recommended.

### Step 3: Start Compressing

Now it's the time to start processing your video, here is how:

1. Go to the File Menu
2. Select Save as AVI...
3. Select where you want to save the AVI and name it.
4. Click Save.

## Conclusion

The VirtualDub MPEG-2 needs some time to compress your video. The larger the video file is, the longer. But VirtualDub MPEG2 is a fast video processing software. Take a cup of coffee and relax. Once finished, use your favorite video player to see the compressing result.

If you don't like VirtualDub MPEG-2 and would like to find some more powerful editors, you can try [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which supports Windows and Mac OS with high compatibility of input and output formats. Wizard-style interface and intuitive design will help you to compress video or any other editing operation easily and smoothly. Try it today by downloading the free trial version below.

## Cast Local Videos to Chromecast: A Step-by-Step Guide for All Devices

# How to Stream Local Video to Chromecast on Windows/Mac/Android/iOS

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Get below a detailed Chromecast app list. It tells you how to stream local files to TV through Chromecast from PC, Mac, Android, or iPhone, iPad and more. Now the Google cast supported video formats are limited to MP4 and WebM. If you have the format incompatibility issue, just use [Video Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/)to convert your video to be supported by Chrome.

To stream local files to TV from PC or Mac, there are totally 4 ways to choose from. Just get the 4 solutions below.

* [Solution 1: Cast Chrome browser to TV](#part1)
* [Solution 2: Cast with Wondershare Video Converter](#part2)
* [Solution 3: Cast with Plex for Chromecast](#part3)
* [Solution 4: Cast with Videostream for Google Chromecast](#part3)

## Solution 1: Cast Chrome browser to TV

![cast chrome browser to tv](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/chromecast/connect-chromecast.jpg)

### Step 1\. Install Chrome browser and Chromecast extension

Make sure that you have the latest version of Chrome. You can check by clicking Settings > About Google Chrome to update your chrome.

### Step 2: Connect Chromecast with TV

Plug in Chromecast in the HDMI input on your TV, and then plug the USB cord on the other end of the Chromecast to power it.

![cast from chrome browser](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/chromecast/cast-browser.jpg)

### Step 3.Connect WiFi

Make sure that your computer and TV are connected in the same network. You should be connected to 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi network.  
If your Chromecast can't be connected to the Wi-Fi network, please [check the Chromecast router compatibility here](https://support.google.com/chromecast/table/3477832?hl=en&ref%5Ftopic=3205565).

### Step 4.Install Google cast extension

[Please download Google cast extension here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-cast/boadgeojelhgndaghljhdicfkmllpafd?hl). After installation, there will be a Cast tab on the Chrome browser. You can click the option button to set video quality as Extreme (720p high bitrate) or High (720p) for your HD TV.

![cast from chrome browser](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/chromecast/cast-video.jpg)

### Step 5\. Play local Video or music

Drag your local files to chrome browser, or press Ctr + O to browse and import your files. And then your video will be played in Chrome's built-in video viewer. Then click the Cast current tab on your browser to stream media files to Chromecast and then play it on TV.

Also you can choose Cast entire screen to share your desktop screen instead of a Chrome tab to TV.

**Note:**

1\. If your videos can't be streamed, that's because Chromecast doesn't support these formats. [You can check all the supported media here](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/media). If you really want to cast any format, check the second solution.

2\. Stream video in background: When you stream video to your TV, you can use the 2 Windows short cuts to stream local video to Chromecast in background.  
Alt+Tab: It lets you do other things by switching to other opened programs/apps  
Ctrl+Esc: You can start a new program by pressing the 2 buttons to pop up the Star menu.

## Solution 2: Cast with Wondershare Video Converter

![stream files by video converter](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-converter-ultimate/stream-files-on-convert.jpg)

### Step 1\. Install Wondershare UniConverter

<

Download and install [Wondershare UniConverter Video Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/) from its official website page.

### Step 2\. Import any video to the software

Make sure your Chromecast and PC are located in the same network. Then click the "Add Files" button or directly drag-n-drop to import your video to the program. After that, click the "Stream" pane on the right side and choose your Chromecast as the streaming device. When everything is ready, hit the "Stream" button at the bottom.

![cast from converter](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-converter-ultimate/start-streaming.jpg)

### Step 3\. Start streaming

In the pop up window, click the "Play To TV" button to stream your video to Chromecast. Then after a few seconds, you can enjoy your video right on the big screen. You can also control the playback process by clicking the perspective buttons in the streaming window. That's done!

## Solution 3: Cast with Plex for Chromecast

![plex chromecast](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/chromecast/plex-download.jpg)

More Information about [How to use Plex for Chromecast](https://plexapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200264746-Quick-start-Step-by-Step).

## Solution 4: Cast with Videostream for Google Chromecast
