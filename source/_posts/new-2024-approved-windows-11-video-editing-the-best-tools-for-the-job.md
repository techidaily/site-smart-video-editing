 **Add transitions or credit/intro**

To add transitions, you can click **Transitions** at the top, and then drag your favorite transition effect to the track over the video to apply. Then double click it to set the transition duration freely. As you can see, you can also apply one favorite transition effect to all the clips or let the software randomly add transitions for you. To make your videos more stunning, you can also switch to the “Intro/Credit” tab to add different intro/ credit effect to timeline. To change the effect and text, choose the “Title” function and customize it as you like.
