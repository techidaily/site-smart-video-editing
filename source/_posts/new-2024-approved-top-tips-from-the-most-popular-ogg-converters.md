### 01What Does OGG Means?

OGG is a file format that was developed by the Xiph Foundation, specifically for encoding audio and video file types. It is freely available and open-source. This format can be used by anyone with the right skills and knowledge. Additionally, file formats like this can contain not only the audio data but also video, text (like subtitles), and metadata related to the audio. It is a credit to the word 'Jargon,' which is slang for slang used on the computer game Netrek.

### 02Is OGG Better Than MP3?

OGG (or Open Source Graphics) is a popular audio file format. These are often preferred over MP3 as the files are easily readable and can have equal quality thru conversions. For better understanding, let's have a look at other related details for both MP3 and OGG:-

**●** Both OGG & MP3 are compressed formats, but they have distinct differences. OGG files are smaller and less lossy, you will get higher quality with OGG files, and sometimes you can hear the difference even under close-to-same levels of compression.

**●** OGG is a file format that can only be developed by resource-rich companies. But it has huge benefits, such as being free, open, and owned by the public.

**●** OGG is an audio codec that uses a variable bit rate, which enables it to preserve bandwidth.

**●** MP3 is right up there with other formats when it comes to quality and size, but the OGG format compresses files into smaller sizes and maintains a better quality than the MP3 file.

**●** OGG files have a bit rate of several hundred Kbps, whereas MP3 format only reaches up to 320 Kbps. The difference, however, should not be too big of a concern.

01 [What is OGG?](#Part 1)

02 [Eight Online and Free OGG to MP4 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 What is OGG?

### 01What Does OGG Means?

OGG is a file format that was developed by the Xiph Foundation, specifically for encoding audio and video file types. It is freely available and open-source. This format can be used by anyone with the right skills and knowledge. Additionally, file formats like this can contain not only the audio data but also video, text (like subtitles), and metadata related to the audio. It is a credit to the word 'Jargon,' which is slang for slang used on the computer game Netrek.

### 02Is OGG Better Than MP3?

OGG (or Open Source Graphics) is a popular audio file format. These are often preferred over MP3 as the files are easily readable and can have equal quality thru conversions. For better understanding, let's have a look at other related details for both MP3 and OGG:-

**●** Both OGG & MP3 are compressed formats, but they have distinct differences. OGG files are smaller and less lossy, you will get higher quality with OGG files, and sometimes you can hear the difference even under close-to-same levels of compression.

**●** OGG is a file format that can only be developed by resource-rich companies. But it has huge benefits, such as being free, open, and owned by the public.

**●** OGG is an audio codec that uses a variable bit rate, which enables it to preserve bandwidth.

**●** MP3 is right up there with other formats when it comes to quality and size, but the OGG format compresses files into smaller sizes and maintains a better quality than the MP3 file.

**●** OGG files have a bit rate of several hundred Kbps, whereas MP3 format only reaches up to 320 Kbps. The difference, however, should not be too big of a concern.

### 03How to Play OGG Files?

When you are looking forward to playing the OGG files, it is important to convert them. Most devices available do not support the file format, due to which you cannot play them directly. Maybe the operating system at which you are using the device may support it but if it is not, look out for converter tools.

### 04Which Other Formats OGG Can Be Converted into and Why

Different formats are available in which you can convert OGG like MP4, WEBM and AVI and so on. The reason behind doing the conversion is that devices do not allow users to play the content directly due to the lack of features in them.

## Basic Video Editing Terms You Should Know

Below are some of the important yet basic terms that you should know related to videography in general and video editing in specific as well, whether you are a beginner or professional.

**Aspect ratio:**

The aspect ratio is the ratio of width and height of a video. Examples of the most used aspect ratios are: 4:3, 16:9, 1.85:1.

Refer to the image given below for a better understanding.

![aspec ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/aspec-ratio.jpg)

**B-roll:**

B-roll facilities one with the flexibility, when editing, to the video editing rules as it is an add-on picture that makes a previously incoherent scene seamless.

As shown in the image below, B-roll is used to insert which can make the transition easy to look on the eyes.

**Bit rate:**

Bit rate, also known as data rate, refers to the amount of data used for every second within the video. It is most commonly expressed in kilobits per second (kbps).

**Close up:**

Close-up refers to the shots that frame to subject tightly.

For instance, if it is a person, then the close-up covers solely his face.

**Color temperature:**

Color temperature refers to the light visibility in a shot. Color temperature is expressed in Kelvin. The scale of color temperature ranges from cool to warm.

![color temperature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/color-temperature.jpg)

**Composition:**

Composition entails the process of combining multiple footages using video editing software.

**Compression:**

Compression is the process of minimizing the quantity of data utilized in a video file. It helps make in the process of uploading and downloading quite faster. This also leaves you with ample space for more of your publications.

**Crop factor:**

Crop factor refers to a number that expresses the ratio of the imaging area of a sensor to a full-frame sensor. It typically ranges from 1.3 to 2.0.

**Cut-in**

Cut-in refers to showing a specific part of a subject in order to emphasize a certain aspect or emotion. For instance, hand gestures may show nervousness, enthusiasm, agitation, etc.

**Foley:**

Often times the original sound of the scene captured in the video is not captured as naturally as they were supposed to sound like in reality. Hence, Foley is when you reproduce those sounds for that video.

**Frame rate:**

Frame rate refers to the video capturing by a shutter in a second or shutter cycling rate through opening and closing. Some of the common frame rates are 24, 25, 29.97, 30, etc. The frame rate is expressed in frames per second (fps).

**High definition media interface:**

HDMI is the connectors that digitally transfer audio and HD video to a television. This is helpful if you intend to work on a bigger screen or wish to share some of your productions.

**Resolution:**

Resolution refers to the horizontal and vertical pixels of your video. For instance 640×480 for SD and 1280×720 for HD. Sometimes resolution refers only to the number of pixels that paper vertically. For example 480p, 720p, and 1080p respectively.

![resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resolution.jpg)

**J-Cut:**

J-cut refers to the editing technique in which the audio from a next scene is overlapped with the image from the previous scene, such that the audio segment of the next scene begins playing prior to its picture.

**Jumpcut:**

Jumpcut editing techniques refer to an abrupt transition between the two consecutive frames. The entity in the video containing jump cuts appears to jump along with the scene from one place to another. This looks disruptive to the audience.

**L-Cut:**

L-cut is exactly opposite to J-cut where the audio from the next scene overlays the image from the next scene to play the audio after an image has been displayed in the video.

**Lower third:**

As the name suggests, the lower third is derived from the rule of third which refers to the type of title, mostly used by vloggers, broadcasters, interviewers, and you tubers.

**Memory bank**:

You can understand the term by thinking of a memory box where we keep certain things as a memory of the events in someone’s life. Memory bank serves the same purpose through the use of video. It often uses natural sounds, document travel or merely store moments in routine life.

**Press kit:**

Press kit is used to provide information regarding your productions to the press for promotional purposes. Such information is often background including synopsis, crew, cast’s bios Q&A with the director, production stills and its reviews.

**Shot list:**

The shot list refers to the checklist related to the shots that a videographer plans to include in his/her content. This may help you save time and gear with efficient planning and handling. This gives a sense of direction to your production.

**Storyboard:**

A storyboard is a drawing to illustrate the scenes in the video. This gives a direct and organized way to visualize the needs for the shots or animation.

![storyboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/storyboard.jpg)

**Sync:**

Synchronization, aka sync, refers to the alignment of audio with video imaging.

**Rule of thirds:**

The rule of third is a grid that helps you to compose interesting and balanced shots to make your productions aesthetically pleasing. The grid is similar to a tic-tac-toe board since it segregates the picture into 9 segments. It helps bring points of interest to be aligned with the lines or intersection given in the grid.

![rule of thirds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/rule-of-thirds.jpg)

**Three-point lighting:**

This helps one to diminish the shadows for image balancing and provides an appealing contrast. These three lights are commonly known as fill, key, and backlight.

![three point lighting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/three-point-lighting.jpg)

**Tilts:**

Tilts refer to the vertical transitions that your camera. This is the opposite of pans.

![tilts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/tilts.jpg)

**Pans:**

Pans refer to the horizontal movements of your camera. This is exactly contrary to tilts.

**White balance:**

White balance refers to the process where the unrealistic color casts are removed in order to render a white object to be actually white in your photo, and not have other tints.

![white balance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/white-balance.jpg)

**Wide-angle:**

A wide-angel lens refers to a short focal length of a lens. This brings more of a subject rather than a subject being captured by a normal lens at equal distances.

![wide angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/wide-angle.jpg)

**Non-linear editing:**

NLEs is a non-destructive editing technique that allows one to access any frame in a video clip regardless of the sequence in the clip. It gives you the freedom to easily include effects, transitions, fades, etc. which cannot be achieved with linear editing

**Pixel aspect ratio:**

Pixels are several tiny squares that build up an image in a video. Whereas, aspect ratio refers to the ratio of width to height of a video. Hence, the pixel aspect ratio (PAR) is the ratio of width to height of the pixels.

## Conclusion

Be it Instagram stories, YouTube product testimonials, or Facebook ads, using these easy-to-use video editing software will elevate your content into a professional and slick look.

So, I hope you are now ready to get started.

It comes with a lot of features that make it a perfect match for both amateurs and professionals. The multilayer timeline makes it easier for you to handle multiple tracks at the same time. It's just like various video editing apps that only work on pc. You have the green screen and chrome key option, so you can easily remove and change the background of your videos. You have options for adjusting the keyframe and masking. The support for sharing your videos across different platforms is also there. Overall, you have pretty much everything here that you need to edit your videos.

### **Sound And Music Options**

This app allows you to edit the sound of your videos also. You can add any music of your choice to your videos. You can mark the music rhythm just like you do in professional PC video editors. You have the support for multiple soundtracks, and you can also adjust the duration of your soundtracks. So, now you can edit your videos with a diverse music style.

### **Great Video Effects**

You can add plenty of effects to your videos using this mobile app. You can add title slides, text animations, and overlays, etc. You can freely change your video speed as you want. There is the support of the LUT filter, and you can add plenty of transitions between your videos. Overall the effects pack of this video editor is pretty awesome.

### **Simple Save and Share Options**

In this video editor, you can easily save videos to your gallery with just a few clicks. You also have different buttons to share your edited videos to different platforms like Youtube, Twitter, and Facebook, etc.

## **Final Verdict**

VN Video Editor is a mobile-based video editing app. It is an easy and powerful tool to edit all kinds of videos, especially with HD quality. With it, you can trim, crop, merge and rotate your photos, add watermarks, and so much more for both Android and IOS users. However, it does not support some advanced video editing features. If you are looking for such features, you can consider Filmora X Video Editor. It has the most professional features, including Magic Cut, Smart Blur, and other features that you don't find in many other apps.

So, if you edit videos occasionally and don't need many professional results, then you can go for vn video editor apk download. Otherwise, head to the wondershare website and download the Filmora X video editor on your desktop to get professional results.
