We have eight recommendations for you below that will allow you to pretty much do whatever you want (i.e., **convert FLAC to MP3**, convert **FLAC to ALAC**, **convert WAV to FLAC**, MP4 to FLAC, FLAC to MP4, M4A to FLAC, WAV to FLAC, and so much more.)

We've even included a handy general tutorial just after this to make sure that you're able to easily make use of your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)](#Part 1)

02 [8 Best Free FLAC to MP3 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)**

As promised, we'll be starting this off with a general tutorial that you can refer to when using the converters that we've listed below! The tool that we will be using for this step-by-step breakdown is an online **FLAC Converter** called FreeConvert. We did not include it on our list just to make sure that you have the most options possible, but it definitely deserves a spot of its own, since it is a **free FLAC converter** as well.

### 01**Step 1: Open FLAC Converter!**

To start things off, you need to either launch (if it's software) or open (a.i., open the website for an online converter) your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

Once you've got your **FLAC Converter** all revved up. The first true step is the 'UPLOAD' step. This is when you use the upload features provided to prepare the FLAC audio that you want to convert.

For the tool we use for our example, you can do it in one of two ways:

**●** Upload Manually: Either from your device, from Dropbox, from Google Drive, or through a URL link.

**●** Drag-and-Drop: Simply drag and then drop the FLAC audio for conversion.

Here's a link to FreeConvert in case you wanted to try it out for yourself:

![Upload FLAC Audio File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%201.png)

### 02**Step 2: Confirm Output Format!**

For our example, we'll be converting from **FLAC to MP3**. And so, when prompted to choose the desired output format, we choose "MP3"!

(Most converters will have multiple audio file formats and video file formats that you can convert to if you want to do something completely different — as is shown below):

![Confirm MP3 as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%202.png)

### 03**Step 3: (Optional) Advanced Settings**

Before finishing up, you might want to explore the extra advanced settings offered by your chosen **FLAC Converter**! Each one will have different features.

FreeConvert, as an example, will allow you to adjust volume, add fade-in, add fade-out, reverse audio, and, even, trim audio before conversion! All you have to do to access these functions is to click the "SETTINGS" icon (pointed out in the image).

![Advance Settings Icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%203.png)

### 04**Step 4: Convert FLAC to MP3**

To initiate the actual conversion with FreeConvert, all you really need to do is click the 'Convert to MP3' button. Other **FLAC converter**s, while not the same, should be similar.

![Select Convert to MP3 Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%204.png)

### 05**Step 5: Download Converted FLAC Audio!**

Finally, when the conversion has been completed, select the 'Download MP3' button to save your converted audio to your PC! That's it, you're done!

We have eight recommendations for you below that will allow you to pretty much do whatever you want (i.e., **convert FLAC to MP3**, convert **FLAC to ALAC**, **convert WAV to FLAC**, MP4 to FLAC, FLAC to MP4, M4A to FLAC, WAV to FLAC, and so much more.)

We've even included a handy general tutorial just after this to make sure that you're able to easily make use of your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)](#Part 1)

02 [8 Best Free FLAC to MP3 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)**

As promised, we'll be starting this off with a general tutorial that you can refer to when using the converters that we've listed below! The tool that we will be using for this step-by-step breakdown is an online **FLAC Converter** called FreeConvert. We did not include it on our list just to make sure that you have the most options possible, but it definitely deserves a spot of its own, since it is a **free FLAC converter** as well.

### 01**Step 1: Open FLAC Converter!**

To start things off, you need to either launch (if it's software) or open (a.i., open the website for an online converter) your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

Once you've got your **FLAC Converter** all revved up. The first true step is the 'UPLOAD' step. This is when you use the upload features provided to prepare the FLAC audio that you want to convert.

For the tool we use for our example, you can do it in one of two ways:

**●** Upload Manually: Either from your device, from Dropbox, from Google Drive, or through a URL link.

**●** Drag-and-Drop: Simply drag and then drop the FLAC audio for conversion.

Here's a link to FreeConvert in case you wanted to try it out for yourself:

![Upload FLAC Audio File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%201.png)

### 02**Step 2: Confirm Output Format!**

For our example, we'll be converting from **FLAC to MP3**. And so, when prompted to choose the desired output format, we choose "MP3"!

(Most converters will have multiple audio file formats and video file formats that you can convert to if you want to do something completely different — as is shown below):

![Confirm MP3 as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%202.png)

### 03**Step 3: (Optional) Advanced Settings**

Before finishing up, you might want to explore the extra advanced settings offered by your chosen **FLAC Converter**! Each one will have different features.

FreeConvert, as an example, will allow you to adjust volume, add fade-in, add fade-out, reverse audio, and, even, trim audio before conversion! All you have to do to access these functions is to click the "SETTINGS" icon (pointed out in the image).

![Advance Settings Icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%203.png)

### 04**Step 4: Convert FLAC to MP3**

To initiate the actual conversion with FreeConvert, all you really need to do is click the 'Convert to MP3' button. Other **FLAC converter**s, while not the same, should be similar.

![Select Convert to MP3 Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%204.png)

### 05**Step 5: Download Converted FLAC Audio!**

Finally, when the conversion has been completed, select the 'Download MP3' button to save your converted audio to your PC! That's it, you're done!

![Select Download MP3 Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%205.png)

## 10 Essential Online Video Rotation Software for Creators

# Best Online Video Rotators for Rotating Videos \[Win/Mac\]

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Until recently, horizontally oriented videos were one of the rare undisputed industry standards, but with the rapid advancement of phone cameras and social media networks that support vertically oriented videos, a growing number of people need to rotate their videos. It is important to note that if you choose to rotate a video, the results you are going to get maybe underwhelming, to say the least, because the video’s aspect ratio is going to remain the same. The process of rotating a video is rather simple, and you don’t need access to a professional video editing app like Adobe Premiere Pro to perform this task, because there are quite a few online platforms you can use to rotate your videos online.

## Rotate Video with Animation in Wondershare Filmora on Windows and Mac

Wondershare Filmora is a widely used video editor for YouTubers on the market. In the latest Filmora version, you can add animation to rotation, and make the video rotation animated.

![Rotate video with animation in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rotate-video-with-animation.jpg)

Double click the video, elements, titles, or images in the track, and then go to the Animation tab, you will find some animation presets such as zoom in and zoom out, here, let’s go to Customize option. Adjust the rotation, scale, position, and opacity to get an amazing result.

## How to Rotate Videos Online For Free

The number of supported file formats, as well as the maximum size of a video file you can upload to the platforms that allow its users to rotate videos, can limit your options significantly. That’s why you need to make sure that each video you want to rotate online meets the platform’s specifications. Let’s take a look at some of the best online platforms you can use to rotate your videos online.

#### 2. Kapwing

Website: <https://www.kapwing.com/rotate>

![online video rotator - kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rotate-video-online-in-kapwing.jpg)

Kapwing is an [online video editing platform](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that offers a wide spectrum of video editing tools that enable you to resize or add text to videos, among other things. You can either **upload a video** to Kapwing from your computer or you can **use the video’s URL to import it to Kapwing** if it is stored online.

Once you’ve uploaded the file you simply have to choose if you want to **rotate a video for 90, 180, or 270 degrees** and click on the Export Video button. Kapwing provides the rotation presets of 90, 180, 270, and 360 degrees, which allows you to rotate the video quickly. When you click the Rotate button, you will see the degree number beside. What about rotating at any angle? That’s simple in Kapwing, you can drag the Rotate button to any degree based on your need. Please note if you’re using the Kapwing free plan, the largest video that you can upload is 250MB.

#### 3. Ezgif

Website: <https://ezgif.com/rotate-video>

![online video rotator - ezgif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ezgif-rotate-video-online.jpg)

Cropping videos, changing the playback speed of videos, or cutting videos are only a few among the numerous options Ezgif provides. The platform supports a wide range of video file formats such as **MP4, AVI, or MOV,** but **you can’t use Ezgif to rotate videos that are larger than 100MB.** After you upload a video using its URL or directly from your computer, you can choose to flip a video horizontally and vertically or **rotate it by 90, 180, and 270 degrees**.

Make sure that the checkbox next to the option you’ve selected is checked, **choose the output format,** and then **click on the Rotate button**. You will be able to see the result in the **Rotated Video box,** and you just have to click on the **Save icon** located below the video to save it to a hard drive on your computer.

#### 4. Clideo

Website: <https://clideo.com/rotate-video>

![online video rotator - Clideo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clideo-rotate-video-online.jpg)

Clideo provides 2 rotation options for you to rotate the video quickly, so you can convert a portrait video to horizontal without any effort. Besides uploading a video from your computer Video Rotate also lets you import videos you stored on Dropbox, Google Drive, and URL, but the platform won’t let you upload videos larger than **500MB** for free plan users.

Once the upload process is completed, you will be able to **rotate a video left or right**. When done, simply click on the **Export**  button, wait for the video to be rotated, and **hit the Download Result button** to save the video.

#### 5. Rotatemyvideo

Website: <https://rotatemyvideo.net/>

![online video rotator - Rotatemyvideo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rotatemyvideo-online-video-rotator.jpg)

The process of rotating a video with this online video editing tool is both quick and simple. After you arrive at the homepage you just have to click on the **Pick Video**  button to start uploading the video you’d like to rotate. However, **you won’t be able to import videos that are stored online**, because the platform doesn’t offer this option. The maximum video size you can upload is limited to   **250MB**.

Click the left or the right arrow button to rotate the video to the left or right. Besides **rotating a video clockwise or counterclockwise you can also change its aspect ratio or choose the color of the bands**. The Rotatemyvide platform lets you **share the results on Facebook and YouTube**, or you can save the video to your phone or your computer.
