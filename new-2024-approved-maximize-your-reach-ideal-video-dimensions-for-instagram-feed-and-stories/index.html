<p>*****With the correct video settings one can flawlessly post his videos for his followers. Here mentioned are some types of video post that can show you the ideal aspect ratio and best resolution for Instagram:</p>
<p><strong>❶ Instagram reels</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Description:</strong> Reels are seen vertically on the mobile phones. Also these are shot using the Instagram application only so you can take the advantage of transitions and effects present within the application to create your reels effectively. The maximum length for Instagram reels must be 60 seconds. Usually the bottom part of these reel videos is for captions and descriptions, so there should be no important information at that place.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Ideal Aspect Ratio:</strong> The ideal aspect ratio for Instagram reels is 9:16.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Best Resolution:</strong> For Instagram reels; best recommended resolution is 1080*1920 PX.</p>

                      alt="Instagram reels videos"
                ></p>
<p><strong>❷ Instagram Feed</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Description:</strong> The first thing that a user sees is the feed as soon he opens his Instagram. People love to scroll their Instagram feeds and this is the reason why feed videos are getting popular day by day. Instagram feed supports so many sizes and dimensions of the videos. As this app does not rotate on smartphones so it is better to keep the resolution less.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Ideal Aspect Ratio:</strong> For your feed videos, best aspect ratio would be 4:5.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Best Resolution:</strong> The videos must have the resolution of 1080 by 1350 PX so that they can be considered as the best one.</p>

Well, there can be some reasons or problems due to which this happens. Such as Prime Video playing in Smart TV, Phone of Mi TV not appearing widescreen to have a better view or sometimes outline bars appear that makes the visible area quite less. What to do to solve the issue or if there exists some solution? Let’s take a look over some of the reasons due to which Amazon Prime Video widescreen does not appear as required:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Some of the devices do not support particular resolution videos.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In some devices under the settings, there comes an app scaling option to make Amazon Prime Video widescreen. However, this is not the official way to do so, though it works many times. But, this option varies from system to system.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> This often occurs when the dimension of the device screen mismatch with that of the video aspect ratio. Since a 16:9 aspect ratio or 1920X1080 pixel resolution is required for a Full HD video, device dimension varies, say 2400X1080 pixels. Now, if you want to see your video in a 1:1 ratio, then around 240 pixel wide black bars will appear on either side of the video if kept in landscape mode.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you try to zoom in on the video, black bars will disappear, resulting in cropping the video visuals from the side.</p>
<p>A possible solution can be using some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> support to adjust the screen resolution or aspect ratio of the video as per the requirement of the device.

<p>Cartooning a photo is a simple and yet effective way of enhancing a picture and making it more visually appealing. Besides adding an artistic touch to portraits you take, cartooning a photo can also be a great way to have fun with your friends because the results of picture cartooning can be as entertaining as visually striking.</p>
<p>Besides portraiture, this visual effect can be applied to virtually any other genre of photography, although the contents of the shoot usually determine how well the effect is going to work. What’s more, you don’t need a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional video editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to cartoon a photo, since there are so many websites that let you apply this effect to your photos for free.</p>
<p>That’s why we selected some of the best websites for converting a photo into a cartoon.</p>
<h2 id="10-Best-Online-Cartoon-Photo-Makers-3"><a href="#10-Best-Online-Cartoon-Photo-Makers-3" class="headerlink" title="10+ Best Online Cartoon Photo Makers"></a>10+ Best Online Cartoon Photo Makers</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Making cartoons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> out of photos doesn’t have to be a difficult task that takes a lot of effort to complete. In fact, online cartoon photo makers are easy to use and they don’t require you to have a lot of photo editing experience.</p>
<p>We’ve selected some of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best online photo editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and photo converters that enable you to cartoon your photos in just a few clicks.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Best-Free-Online-Cartoon-Photo-Editors-3"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Free-Online-Cartoon-Photo-Editors-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Free Online Cartoon Photo Editors"></a>Part 1: Best Free Online Cartoon Photo Editors</h3><p>You don’t have to purchase an expensive photo editing software if you want to cartoon your photos because there are so many different online photo editing platforms that allow you to apply this effect to your photos for free. Let’s take a closer look at what they have to offer.</p>
<h4 id="2-BeFunky-3"><a href="#2-BeFunky-3" class="headerlink" title="2. BeFunky"></a>2. BeFunky</h4><p>Befunky is one of the best photo editors you can find online, which is why it is hardly surprising that it offers cartoonization effects. In fact, you can choose from <strong>five different cartoonization effects</strong> that are all equally impressive.</p>
<p>All of the cartoon effects Befunky has to offer are located in the Artsy menu, and you just have to click on Cartoonizer DLX, Cross Hatch DLX, Pop Art DLX, or Graphic Novel DLX effects in order to apply them to your photo. Furthermore, you can use the Erase mode if you don’t want to catoonize the entire photo or head over to the Adjust menu to specify the amount of the effect you’ll apply and increase or decrease the photo’s sharpness.</p>
<p>Go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/" >https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you can then turn your photos to cartoon easily in BeFunky.</p>
<h4 id="3-Lunapic-3"><a href="#3-Lunapic-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Lunapic"></a>3. Lunapic</h4><p>This is yet another online photo editing platform that gives you access to a broad range of photo editing options for free. Even though a bit outdated, the Lunapic’s interface resembles Photoshop’s interface, so you won’t need much time to get used to it if you ever used Adobe’s iconic photo editing software.</p>
<p>Once you’ve uploaded a photo, you just have to go to the Effects menu and select the Cartoon option. Lunapic will then automatically apply the effect to the photo you uploaded and you just need to preview the image before you save it. The only downside is that you can’t adjust the effect’s settings in case you don’t like the results.</p>
<p>If you want to add cartoon effect to photo with this photo editor, you can go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www12.lunapic.com/editor/?action=cartoon" >https://www12.lunapic.com/editor/?action=cartoon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h4 id="4-wish2be-cartoon-photo-editor-3"><a href="#4-wish2be-cartoon-photo-editor-3" class="headerlink" title="4. wish2be cartoon photo editor"></a>4. wish2be cartoon photo editor</h4><p>If you would like to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >turn yourself or your friends into a cartoon character <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Wish2Be cartoon photo editor can be a fun option. The platform’s Free Caricature feature allows you to become a cartoon character in just three easy steps.</p>
<p>You start by customizing the background, selecting the body type, hairstyle, or adding different accessories, gadgets, or even weapons. Once you are done, you can proceed to upload a photo of the person you want to turn into a cartoon character. Optionally, you can add a text layer and adjust its position and size within the picture. If you like the caricature you created, you can buy a print or you can choose to share your design for free. The Pro Cartoonizer feature this platform offers is only available if you purchase one of the available subscription plans.</p>
<p>Here is the website <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wish2be.com/app/cartoon-photo-editor/" >https://www.wish2be.com/app/cartoon-photo-editor/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for cartoon photos with Wish2Be.</p>
<h4 id="5-SnapsTouch-3"><a href="#5-SnapsTouch-3" class="headerlink" title="5. SnapsTouch"></a>5. SnapsTouch</h4><p>This is a simple online photo editor that lets you turn your photos into sketches, paintings, or drawings. Choosing the Painting option is probably the easiest way to turn a photo into a cartoon, although this effect can also be achieved with the Pencil Sketch feature.</p>
<p>After you upload a photo you want to turn into a cartoon, you can choose between Painting 1 and Painting 2 options in order to determine the style of the cartoon you’re creating. In addition, you can decide if you want to include the outline in the painting as well as set the size of the brush and how many levels the final image should have. Click on the Paint button and wait for SnapsTouch to generate the cartoonized picture, and you can then proceed to download it to your computer.</p>

In addition, you can also add text to each photo you cartoonize with the platform and choose a font or the size and color of the text. Moreover, each effect can be adjusted using the Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, and Hue sliders. The only downside is that the platform watermarks all photos you edit with it and you must purchase the PhotoCartoon software in order to remove it.</p>

<p>In addition, you can choose whether or not you want to make a soft drawing. In case you do, you can adjust the Softness Level and Softness Extent values and then click on the Generate button.

<p>Online cartoon photo editors and converters are remarkably easy to use, and they enable you to turn any photo you take into an entertaining cartoon in just a few clicks.
