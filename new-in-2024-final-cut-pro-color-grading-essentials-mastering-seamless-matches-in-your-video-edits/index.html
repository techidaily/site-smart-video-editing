<p>If you are involved in video editing or post-production activities, then you might be familiar with color matching. In this, we make sure that the overall color and tone of our videos are matched throughout. Thankfully, you can easily do color match in Final Cut Pro or any other reliable video editing tool. In this detailed Final Cut Pro match color tutorial, I will help you do the same and would also share details about its best alternative.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Use-Final-Cut-Pro-X-to-Match-Colors-A-Stepwise-Guide"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Use-Final-Cut-Pro-X-to-Match-Colors-A-Stepwise-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Use Final Cut Pro X to Match Colors: A Stepwise Guide"></a>Part 1: How to Use Final Cut Pro X to Match Colors: A Stepwise Guide</h2><p>Final Cut Pro X has to be one of the most resourceful Mac applications that you can use to edit your videos. If you want, you can use the automatic FCPX match color tool in the application to automatically apply the effect. Besides that, you can manually match color in Final Cut Pro X by using its inbuilt features.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Using the Final Cut Pro Match Color Tool</strong></p>
<p>To use the Final Cut Pro X Match Color feature, you can simply go through these simple steps:</p>
<p><em>Step 1: Load and import the video clips</em></p>
<p>To begin with, you can just launch Final Cut Pro on your Mac and go to its File &gt; Import &gt; Media to load any video clip of your choice. You can simply drag and drop your videos to the Final Cut Pro interface.</p>
<p><em>Step 2: Apply the FCPX Match Color effect</em></p>
<p>Now, simply select the clip you want to edit, go to the Enhancement menu, and click on the Match Color icon (below the viewer). You can also find it under the Modify &gt; Match Color option or get the feature by pressing the Option + Command + M key combination.</p>
<p>Afterward, the Color Match FCPX tool will display two different screens in the viewer. On the right, you would have the clip from where you can match the source while the target clip will be displayed on the left.</p>
<p>From the Final Cut Pro timeline or the browser, you can find the appropriate clips. If you want, you can even import a still image to source the respective colors for matching. Simply preview the changes that the FCPX Color Match tool will make and click on the “Apply Match” in the end.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Adjust the Video Color Manually</strong></p>
<p>Apart from the match color tool in Final Cut, you can also manually set the color grading and saturation feature. While this will not get you instant or exact results to color match in Final Cut Pro, you can still give it a try.</p>
<p>Once the video clip is loaded on Filmora, just go to the Effects Browser &gt; Inspector and add the Color Correction effect to the video. Now, you can go to the Color Correction tab from the sidebar to manually adjust the value for color, saturation, and exposure to get the desired effects.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Wondershare-Filmora-The-Best-Alternative-to-FCPX-Color-Match-Tool"><a href="#Part-2-Wondershare-Filmora-The-Best-Alternative-to-FCPX-Color-Match-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Wondershare Filmora: The Best Alternative to FCPX Color Match Tool"></a>Part 2: Wondershare Filmora: The Best Alternative to FCPX Color Match Tool</h2><p>Since Final Cut Pro is not the most user-friendly application, a lot of people look for other alternatives to perform operations like color match. Therefore, you can also take the assistance of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is a powerful video editing and post-production tool that is extremely easy to use and runs on all the major macOS versions.</p>
<ul>
<li>On Filmora, you can find seamless options like color matching, color tuning, splitting, resizing, scene detection, and so on.</li>
<li>There are also tons of advanced video editing features in Filmora like keyframing, motion detection, green screen edits, etc.</li>
<li>You can find a wide range of effects, presets, texts, stickers, transitions, and more in the Filmora library.</li>
<li>There are also dedicated options to edit audio in your media files or add voiceovers.</li>
<li>Filmora is one of the easiest video editing tools out there with import&#x2F;export options for all the leading formats.</li>
</ul>
<p>To perform automatic color matching in your videos using Wondershare Filmora, the following steps can be taken:</p>
<p><em>Step 1: Import the video to edit on Filmora</em></p>
<p>At first, you can just launch Filmora on your Mac and drag-and-drop the video you want to edit. You can also go to its File &gt; Import Media to load any video of your choice on Filmora and just drag the clips to the timeline (at the bottom).</p>
<p><em>Step 2: Apply Color Correction to your Clips</em></p>
<p>If you want, you can add multiple clips on Filmora and simply add them to the timeline as per your requirements.</p>
<p>You can now take the playhead and place it from where you wish to edit the video. You can select the remaining clip (or photos), right-click, and choose the Color Match option. Alternatively, you can also click on the color palette icon on the timeline’s toolbar and select the “Color Match” button.</p>
<p>This will change the viewer into two screens. Here, you can select the reference picture or clip as a source and preview its effects on the target clip. You can also go to the Color tab on the side and adjust its level under the Comparison View section.</p>
<p>On the viewer window, you can see all the changes, and click on the “Match” button to apply the effect.</p>
<p><em>Step 3: Export your video to a preferred format</em></p>
<p>After making the needed changes and applying the color correction feature, you can go to the Export option of the tool. Here, you can choose a preferred format to export your file and even choose its resolution and video quality.</p>
<p>I’m sure that after reading this post you would be able to apply color match in Final Cut Pro. As you can see, I have included a stepwise tutorial that anyone can follow to use the Final Cut Pro Match Color tool. Though, if you are looking for a better and more user-friendly option, then explore Wondershare Filmora.

In this detailed Final Cut Pro match color tutorial, I will help you do the same and would also share details about its best alternative.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Use-Final-Cut-Pro-X-to-Match-Colors-A-Stepwise-Guide-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Use-Final-Cut-Pro-X-to-Match-Colors-A-Stepwise-Guide-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Use Final Cut Pro X to Match Colors: A Stepwise Guide"></a>Part 1: How to Use Final Cut Pro X to Match Colors: A Stepwise Guide</h2><p>Final Cut Pro X has to be one of the most resourceful Mac applications that you can use to edit your videos. If you want, you can use the automatic FCPX match color tool in the application to automatically apply the effect. Besides that, you can manually match color in Final Cut Pro X by using its inbuilt features.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Using the Final Cut Pro Match Color Tool</strong></p>
<p>To use the Final Cut Pro X Match Color feature, you can simply go through these simple steps:</p>
<p><em>Step 1: Load and import the video clips</em></p>
<p>To begin with, you can just launch Final Cut Pro on your Mac and go to its File &gt; Import &gt; Media to load any video clip of your choice. You can simply drag and drop your videos to the Final Cut Pro interface.</p>
<p><em>Step 2: Apply the FCPX Match Color effect</em></p>
<p>Now, simply select the clip you want to edit, go to the Enhancement menu, and click on the Match Color icon (below the viewer). You can also find it under the Modify &gt; Match Color option or get the feature by pressing the Option + Command + M key combination.</p>
<p>Afterward, the Color Match FCPX tool will display two different screens in the viewer. On the right, you would have the clip from where you can match the source while the target clip will be displayed on the left.</p>
<p>From the Final Cut Pro timeline or the browser, you can find the appropriate clips. If you want, you can even import a still image to source the respective colors for matching. Simply preview the changes that the FCPX Color Match tool will make and click on the “Apply Match” in the end.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Adjust the Video Color Manually</strong></p>
<p>Apart from the match color tool in Final Cut, you can also manually set the color grading and saturation feature. While this will not get you instant or exact results to color match in Final Cut Pro, you can still give it a try.</p>
<p>Once the video clip is loaded on Filmora, just go to the Effects Browser &gt; Inspector and add the Color Correction effect to the video. Now, you can go to the Color Correction tab from the sidebar to manually adjust the value for color, saturation, and exposure to get the desired effects.</p>

<p>Video editing was once exclusively the realm of the PC, but with the power of modern smartphones and tablets even professionals are more frequently editing on the go. This should come as no surprise as most of our photos and footage are stored on mobile devices, while apps like PowerDirector give the full functionality of a professional editing suite on mobile technology.</p>
<p>Currently PowerDirector is only available on Android, but if you’re using an iOS device you’re sadly missing out. Luckily there are several alternative apps that allow you to edit your footage from a mobile device; see our reviews below.</p>
<h2 id="Best-PowerDirector-Alternatives-for-Android-and-iOS-1"><a href="#Best-PowerDirector-Alternatives-for-Android-and-iOS-1" class="headerlink" title="Best PowerDirector Alternatives for Android and iOS"></a>Best PowerDirector Alternatives for Android and iOS</h2><h4 id="1-Kinemaster-£2-91-per-month"><a href="#1-Kinemaster-£2-91-per-month" class="headerlink" title="1. Kinemaster - £2.91 per month"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kinemaster.com/index.php?lang=en" >Kinemaster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - £2.91 per month</h4><p>System: Android, iOS</p>
<p>Kinemaster is an impressive app that brings simplicity to complex professional editing tools, making it easy to use even on a small screen. It supports multiple layers including unlimited text, handwriting and sticker layers, as well as up to two video layers and four additional audio tracks. The precision editing features allow you edit frame by frame and it’s easy to quickly import extra footage and add additional effects. With a host of other features we haven’t mentioned it’s amazing how simple this app is. The only downside is the pricing model; instead of a one-off payment you’re saddled with £2.91 per month, an investment that could end up exceeding the value of the app.</p>
<h4 id="2-LumaFX-£2-99"><a href="#2-LumaFX-£2-99" class="headerlink" title="2. LumaFX - £2.99"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://luma-touch.com/lumafx/" >LumaFX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - £2.99</h4><p>System: iOS</p>
<p>LumaFX is a treasure trove of editing effects and goodies, allowing you to completely change the look of your video. The colour and FX sections of the app have a variety of filters and presets that allow you to do anything from fixing annoying colours to transforming your video into a psychedelic cartoon. The versatility of crop tools is also incredibly impressive, allowing you to crop your clip to different aspect ratios that can then be can be flipped and rotated, slowed down, reversed, and trimmed. Even if you decide on another more powerful editing app, the low cost and range of features of LumaFX makes it ideal for using in conjunction with your app of choice to produce the ultimate video content.</p>
<h4 id="3-iMovie-–-Free"><a href="#3-iMovie-–-Free" class="headerlink" title="3. iMovie – Free"></a>3. iMovie – Free</h4><p>System: iOS</p>
<p>Every iOS user should be familiar with iMovie as it comes bundled on every apple device. Costing nothing is a big upside, especially when the technology handles as intuitively as it does. Splicing footage becomes laughably easy. On the audio side you can add music and personalised voiceovers to your videos and if you’re in the mood for something a little silly there are plenty of over the top TV templates and movie style themes. Accessibility is a big plus for iMovie, but it’s definitely geared to more casual users – professionals will find high end features lacking and should consider a more powerful paid alternative.</p>
<h4 id="4-Adobe-Premiere-Clip-Free"><a href="#4-Adobe-Premiere-Clip-Free" class="headerlink" title="4. Adobe Premiere Clip - Free"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-clip.html" >Adobe Premiere Clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - Free</h4><p>System: Android, iOS</p>
<p>Another free offering, Adobe Premiere Clip shares many of both the benefits and flaws of iMovie. For the casual user its ideal, offering a straightforward means of arranging clips that’s predominantly designed for speed. The creative cloud allows you to continue editing on the desktop Premiere Pro making it a handy extension for existing Adobe customers. It’s also a much more compact download than iMovie; 91 MB compared to 600. There’s a standard array of editing features including trimming and a basic title editor, as well as the option to export options to social sharing sites of your choice, but unless you already work within the creative cloud there’s limited reasons to choose this over the superior iMovie.</p>
<p>There really is no beating PowerDirector for Android, but iOS users should be able to find an app or combination of apps to allow them to continue editing on the move.</p>

This should come as no surprise as most of our photos and footage are stored on mobile devices, while apps like PowerDirector give the full functionality of a professional editing suite on mobile technology.</p>
<p>Currently PowerDirector is only available on Android, but if you’re using an iOS device you’re sadly missing out. Luckily there are several alternative apps that allow you to edit your footage from a mobile device; see our reviews below.</p>

<p>Kinemaster is an impressive app that brings simplicity to complex professional editing tools, making it easy to use even on a small screen. It supports multiple layers including unlimited text, handwriting and sticker layers, as well as up to two video layers and four additional audio tracks. The precision editing features allow you edit frame by frame and it’s easy to quickly import extra footage and add additional effects. With a host of other features we haven’t mentioned it’s amazing how simple this app is. The only downside is the pricing model; instead of a one-off payment you’re saddled with £2.91 per month, an investment that could end up exceeding the value of the app.</p>

<p>LumaFX is a treasure trove of editing effects and goodies, allowing you to completely change the look of your video. The colour and FX sections of the app have a variety of filters and presets that allow you to do anything from fixing annoying colours to transforming your video into a psychedelic cartoon. The versatility of crop tools is also incredibly impressive, allowing you to crop your clip to different aspect ratios that can then be can be flipped and rotated, slowed down, reversed, and trimmed. Even if you decide on another more powerful editing app, the low cost and range of features of LumaFX makes it ideal for using in conjunction with your app of choice to produce the ultimate video content.</p>

<p>Every iOS user should be familiar with iMovie as it comes bundled on every apple device. Costing nothing is a big upside, especially when the technology handles as intuitively as it does. Splicing footage becomes laughably easy. On the audio side you can add music and personalised voiceovers to your videos and if you’re in the mood for something a little silly there are plenty of over the top TV templates and movie style themes. Accessibility is a big plus for iMovie, but it’s definitely geared to more casual users – professionals will find high end features lacking and should consider a more powerful paid alternative.</p>

The creative cloud allows you to continue editing on the desktop Premiere Pro making it a handy extension for existing Adobe customers. It’s also a much more compact download than iMovie; 91 MB compared to 600. There’s a standard array of editing features including trimming and a basic title editor, as well as the option to export options to social sharing sites of your choice, but unless you already work within the creative cloud there’s limited reasons to choose this over the superior iMovie.</p>
<p>There really is no beating PowerDirector for Android, but iOS users should be able to find an app or combination of apps to allow them to continue editing on the move.</p>

<li>Inappropriate configuration or settings of the Final Cut Pro X</li>
<li>Conflict with the plugin template</li>
<li>Incorrect code of the plugin by rookie developers</li>
<li>Incompatibility with the latest version of Final Cut Pro</li>
<li>Incomplete installation of the plugin</li>
</ul>
<p>Among the many reasons for plugin malfunction, one of the most common ones in incorrect or bad code. After all, nobody is protected from rookie developers as they can come with strange codes, causing plugin crashing problems. It is not the user’s mistake if the code is incorrect. Therefore, you should simply consider taking advice from the help center of the plugin site or ask any of their experts to settle the matter.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the plugins are constantly updating by the developers therefore users willing to install the latest plugins should first see whether the plugin is compatible with their Final Cut Pro X version or not. If you do not have the latest version of the software, there are chances that the plugin can crash. You should then consider contacting the expert or simply installing the latest version of the plugin that is best supported by the Final Cut Pro X.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Searching on the Correct Part</strong> - When looking for the plugin, you should always ensure looking for it in the correct part of the Final Cut Pro X. For instance, if you are looking for the effects, make sure that you are checking them in the effects panel.</li>
<li><strong>Proper Installation</strong> - The next tip that you must consider is the correct and proper installation of the plugin. You should follow the steps of the plugin installation in order to avoid incorrect installation in your Final Cut Pro X.</li>
<li><strong>Localization of the Folders</strong> - Now comes the localization of the folders meaning their placement. You should ensure keeping your motion effects, templates, generators, transitions, and titles folders localized.</li>
<li><strong>Placement of the Effects and Transitions</strong> - While placing your titles and generators, you should ensure that they go on the top of your timeline however the transitions can go in between the two clips on the timeline and the effects can be dropped directly into the video clip.</li>
<li><strong>Delete the Plugin from Everywhere</strong> - You should always consider deleting the plugin from everywhere in your system if it continues to trouble you. Delete it from the finder and trash folders, then re-download, re-install and restart your system.</li>
<li><strong>Seek Help from the Plugin Creator</strong> - If none of the aforementioned tips helps, you should definitely turn to the service provider or the plugin creator who can offer you their expert assistance.</li>

The statistics clearly indicate that video content boosts conversion rates, more than any other type of online content, which is the reason why a growing number of marketers choose to incorporate video into their social media marketing strategies.

We’ve combed the Internet to find the best whiteboard animation makers in 2020, so let’s dive in and see what these software products and web-based platforms have to offer.</p>

<p>Moovly is much more than an online destination where you can create whiteboard animations effortlessly as it grants you access to more than a million royalty free images, videos, and sounds. The platform’s video editor lets you choose the gender of the hand that is drawing the animation or its skin color. In addition to simulating the hand drawing process of virtually any object you can think of, the Moovly’s editor also enables you to adjust the size of the elements you add to your story or incorporate handwritten text into the animation video you’re producing.

<p>Formerly known as GoAnimate, Vyond has been one of the best cloud-based video animation platforms for more than a decade. Its Whiteboard Animation theme offers a huge selection of props, character actions and other animated elements that can be useful for videos that cover a broad spectrum of topics. Simply select an element you want to add to your video, fine-tune its size on the screen and it will be drawn automatically. Vyond also enables you to import assets you’ve created which grants you more creative freedom, as you don’t necessarily have to rely solely on the built-in whiteboard animation elements this platform offers. The only downside is that you can’t record voiceovers directly from Vyond, and you either have to use an online voice recording service or utilize a desktop-based software product that enables you to record the narration for your upcoming animated video.</p>

The only downside is that you can’t record voiceovers directly from Vyond, and you either have to use an online voice recording service or utilize a desktop-based software product that enables you to record the narration for your upcoming animated video.</p>

<h4 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4><p>Finding ways to attract the attention of your potential customers is never a simple task, but software products and cloud-based video animation platforms make this process somewhat easier. You don’t have to be a skilled animator in order to create hand drawing whiteboard animations since each of the options we featured in this article requires a minimum amount of technical skill.</p>
<p>However, if you somehow think about making more than just whiteboard video, say normal video editing, why not try out <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? With Filmora, you can make any type of video that you want, including whiteboard videos.</p>
