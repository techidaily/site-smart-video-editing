<p>With several video-sharing platforms and billions of videos on those platforms, it is very difficult and competitive to make your mark and have an identity. There are hundreds of categories of videos that you can find on the platforms like Youtube, Dailymotion, Vimeo, and more. Among all those categories, reaction videos are one of the most popular categories. It allows a person to review another person’s opinion, view, or idea about any particular issue or instance. Most of the video-sharing platforms enable their users to make all kinds of reaction videos without any restriction. Having such a huge competition makes it hard to stand out and attract viewers.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen videos where the reactor has a transparent background instead of the rectangle box in the corner? They look nice and engaging, right? The process of making such videos will require so many materials such as a green screen, stand, and other materials to support it. It is difficult for everyone to afford all these and secondly, it is very difficult to carry from one place to another.</p>
<hr>
<p>With Filmora X, you can create such transparent background reaction videos without such expensive material.

<p><strong>Step 01:</strong> Open Filmora X. If it is not already installed on your PC, you can download it from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and install it on your PC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step1.png"
                      alt="make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step1"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 02:</strong> Import the video that you want to react to and your reaction video. If you have not already recorded your reaction, then record it first using any camera or smartphone.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step2.png"
                      alt="make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step2"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 03:</strong> Place both of these videos into the timeline. Make sure to place your reaction above.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step3.png"
                      alt="make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step3.png"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 04:</strong> Select your reaction video on the timeline and go to the “Effects”. Here you will find a new folder named “AI Portrait”, open it. Here you will find multiple AI portrait effects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step4.png"
                      alt="make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step4"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 05:</strong> Our goal is to remove the background of the reaction. To do that, we will use Human Segmentation. Drag and drop Human Segmentation into the reaction video. If you haven’t purchased this effect already, it will ask you to buy it to export the video. But you want to try it first, click on “Try It.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step5.png"
                      alt="make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step5"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 06:</strong> Once the effect is successfully applied to the video, its background will be removed automatically.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step6.png"
                      alt="make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step6"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 07:</strong> Adjust the video by making it smaller and place it in the bottom left corner of the screen. Your reaction video is ready to be uploaded on video-sharing platforms.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step7.png"
                      alt="make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step7"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 08:</strong> To make your video look cool and stunning, you can also add multiple other effects to your reaction. AI portrait allows you to add a border around the character to make it look more visible and separate it from another video. Go to the AI portrait and drag Human Border Effect and drop it into your reaction. It will create an outline around the character and make it look more visible.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step8.png"
                      alt="make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step8"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 09:</strong> In some instances, you might need to change the position or size of your reaction. You can easily do that by applying the Keyframes to it. If you feel like changing the part of your reaction at some point in the video, go to that point in the timeline and click on the keyframe button above the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step9.png"
                      alt="make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step9"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Once you click on the keyframe, it will add a keyframe to the video. Now move forward into the timeline to a point and adjust your character’s position by dragging it. Let’s move it to the bottom right corner. It will add another keyframe to the video in the timeline. Now the character will change its position from the left corner to the right corner once it reaches that specific point in time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step10.png"

                ></p>
<h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>AI Portrait allows you to create wonderful effects using artificial intelligence. This is one of the best uses of AI to make stunning reaction videos. It will not only save you a lot of time but will also help you save a lot of money by helping you remove the background of your video without expensive materials such as a green screen and other materials related to it.</p>

<p>With several video-sharing platforms and billions of videos on those platforms, it is very difficult and competitive to make your mark and have an identity. There are hundreds of categories of videos that you can find on the platforms like Youtube, Dailymotion, Vimeo, and more. Among all those categories, reaction videos are one of the most popular categories. It allows a person to review another person’s opinion, view, or idea about any particular issue or instance. Most of the video-sharing platforms enable their users to make all kinds of reaction videos without any restriction. Having such a huge competition makes it hard to stand out and attract viewers.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen videos where the reactor has a transparent background instead of the rectangle box in the corner? They look nice and engaging, right? The process of making such videos will require so many materials such as a green screen, stand, and other materials to support it. It is difficult for everyone to afford all these and secondly, it is very difficult to carry from one place to another.</p>

<p><strong>Step 03:</strong> Place both of these videos into the timeline. Make sure to place your reaction above.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 04:</strong> Select your reaction video on the timeline and go to the “Effects”. Here you will find a new folder named “AI Portrait”, open it. Here you will find multiple AI portrait effects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 05:</strong> Our goal is to remove the background of the reaction. To do that, we will use Human Segmentation. Drag and drop Human Segmentation into the reaction video. If you haven’t purchased this effect already, it will ask you to buy it to export the video. But you want to try it first, click on “Try It.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step5"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 06:</strong> Once the effect is successfully applied to the video, its background will be removed automatically.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step6"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 07:</strong> Adjust the video by making it smaller and place it in the bottom left corner of the screen. Your reaction video is ready to be uploaded on video-sharing platforms.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step7"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 08:</strong> To make your video look cool and stunning, you can also add multiple other effects to your reaction. AI portrait allows you to add a border around the character to make it look more visible and separate it from another video. Go to the AI portrait and drag Human Border Effect and drop it into your reaction. It will create an outline around the character and make it look more visible.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step8"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 09:</strong> In some instances, you might need to change the position or size of your reaction. You can easily do that by applying the Keyframes to it. If you feel like changing the part of your reaction at some point in the video, go to that point in the timeline and click on the keyframe button above the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step9.png"
                      alt="make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step9"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Once you click on the keyframe, it will add a keyframe to the video. Now move forward into the timeline to a point and adjust your character’s position by dragging it. Let’s move it to the bottom right corner. It will add another keyframe to the video in the timeline. Now the character will change its position from the left corner to the right corner once it reaches that specific point in time.</p>

                     lazyload

<p>With several video-sharing platforms and billions of videos on those platforms, it is very difficult and competitive to make your mark and have an identity. There are hundreds of categories of videos that you can find on the platforms like Youtube, Dailymotion, Vimeo, and more. Among all those categories, reaction videos are one of the most popular categories. It allows a person to review another person’s opinion, view, or idea about any particular issue or instance. Most of the video-sharing platforms enable their users to make all kinds of reaction videos without any restriction. Having such a huge competition makes it hard to stand out and attract viewers.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen videos where the reactor has a transparent background instead of the rectangle box in the corner? They look nice and engaging, right? The process of making such videos will require so many materials such as a green screen, stand, and other materials to support it. It is difficult for everyone to afford all these and secondly, it is very difficult to carry from one place to another.</p>
<hr>
<p>With Filmora X, you can create such transparent background reaction videos without such expensive material. Filmora has launched a new feature name AI Portrait that uses artificial intelligence to create amazing and cool effects. It uses the latest technology to separate the background and humans in the footage to help you remove the background with a single click. So, let’s get started with the process of making stunning reaction videos with Filmora’s AI Portrait.</p>

<p>It is important that how your video appears on the screen and for this aspect ratio is one of the most important factors. Several times, when your video appears awkward or cropped on a certain site or a device, it means that its aspect ratio is not correct and the best solution here is to change the aspect ratio. Using related software and programs this task can be done easily.</p>
<p>The article will throw more light on these tools that can <strong>change ratio of video</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Aspect-Ratio-and-Why-Does-It-Matter"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Aspect-Ratio-and-Why-Does-It-Matter" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Aspect Ratio and Why Does It Matter?"></a>Part 1 What is Aspect Ratio and Why Does It Matter?</h2><p>Aspect ratio is the relationship between the width and the height of the video and it defines how your video will appear on the screen. The right aspect ratio is important to offer a pleasing viewing experience. With multiple social media sites supporting different aspect ratios, the need for changing them accordingly arises quite often.</p>
<p>The marketing, business, and all other activities have taken an online route and with this, the video content on several social media sites for promotion has also increased. So, if you upload a video with a certain aspect ratio on a different platform, they will look weird with cropped portions, black borders, and other issues that will lead to a negative viewing experience and impact.</p>
<p>Though there is no fixed or standard aspect ratio that can be considered as the best as different values are suitable for different platforms and sites. Some of the commonly used aspect ratios are as below.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 16:9- This is one of the most widely used aspect ratios and appears in the form of a wide rectangle. The majority of the video players as well as capturing devices use this aspect ratio as their default settings. The best resolution that can be used with this aspect ratio is 3840 X 2160 pixels.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 1:1- Originally this aspect ratio was used for square TV sets but now it is majorly used for the videos on Instagram and Facebook. A lot of cameras also support this setting.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 9:16- The setting for this aspect ratio has become popular after the increased use of smartphones. Used for the tall videos, the setting can be seen in the videos posted as an Instagram story, Snapchat, and Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 21:9 – This setting of the aspect ratio is used for cinematic widescreen or videos with the anamorphic format. The use of this aspect ratio is very particular and videos supporting this setting generally can be seen in theme parks, special theatres, and museums.</p>
<p>Regarding social media sites, below listed are the popularly used aspect ratio.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Square (1:1) – Used for Facebook and Instagram feed videos.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Vertical (9:16) – Best for Instagram story videos and snaps</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Horizontal (16:9) – Used for (9:16 YouTube videos</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Landscape (5:4) – Apt for landscape videos on Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Portrait (4:5) – Used for the portrait videos to be posted on Twitter and Facebook.</p>

A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources.

The Macgo Windows Blu-ray player is expected to offer support for a broad range of Blu-ray file formats and video files, which should enable its users to watch or listen to content without any restrictions. The media player can also display a variety of photo file formats, including CR2 files, and its users can utilize it to browse through their photo collections and ever view RAW files.</p>
<p>The current Mac-based versions of the software offer support for Dolby TrueHD Audio DTS-HD Master Audio and DTS 5.1 codecs that ensure you can hear every sound in a video accurately. Macgo Windows Blu-ray should also be equipped with a range of subtitle options that allow you to customize the color, size or the font of a video’s subtitles.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Supports nearly all Blu-ray and video file formats</li>
<li>Powerful audio playback features</li>
<li>Displays image files</li>
<li>Offers online video playback options</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This Blu-ray and DVD player is still in Beta stage</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Even though Windows 10 doesn’t have a native DVD or Blu-ray players, finding a media player that enables you to watch video and audio content from Blu-ray or DVD discs shouldn’t be too difficult. Media players like Pot Player or VLC are powerful enough to provide smooth playback of all audio and video files for free, while DVD players like PowerDVD or KMPlayer are a better option if you are looking for a true home theater experience. Which DVD player for Windows 10 are you going to choose? Leave a comment and let us know.</p>

<p>VSDC is one of the most popular freeware software among beginners and intermediate-level video editors. But it is limited only to Windows users. Even after multiple requests from the users and tech-critics, VSDC isn’t likely to release a VSDC Mac version soon. So, it is best to look for VSDC alternatives for Mac.</p>

</ul>
<p>So, it is not tough to discern why Filmora is considered as one of the most authoritative <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor for Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> users. Moreover, as mentioned, the software is not absolutely free. Still, you can use most of its features in free version.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Top-3-VSDC-Video-Editor-for-Mac-Alternatives"><a href="#Part-2-Top-3-VSDC-Video-Editor-for-Mac-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Top 3 VSDC Video Editor for Mac Alternatives"></a>Part 2: Top 3 VSDC Video Editor for Mac Alternatives</h2><p>After reviewing hundreds of freeware software, we have come up with the three best VSDC alternatives.</p>
<h3 id="1-ShotCut"><a href="#1-ShotCut" class="headerlink" title="1. ShotCut"></a>1. ShotCut</h3><p>A simple, free, and open-source software that makes the video-making process straightforward. Filled with interesting ideas and powerful features, the greatest thing about ShotCut is that besides being free — it is regularly updated and maintained by the vendor. The interface has a three-panel view and adding media files is as simple as dragging and dropping.</p>
<p>The software also includes rich features like keyframing, color correction, transition and lets you edit up to 4K resolution video with ease. But unlike VSDC, ShotCut does not have multiple preset transition effects and includes only 24 basic wipe-in or out effects. Still, the software has sophisticated features like Chroma Key and allows you to utilize third-party addons for text and titles as the application does not have many of them.</p>

                      alt="shortcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight for a sophisticated video-editor</li>
<li>The interface is simple and convenient and allows you to customize the toggles as per your preference</li>
<li>Numerous output options — supports major formats and offers you to export the footage in any format</li>
<li>Completely free platforms plus cross-platform support</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The app does not allow you to create layers automatically.</li>
<li>It could be tough for a newbie to work on ShotCut.</li>
<li>The application takes too long to show the applied effects; even simple transition effects suffer from latency.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-OpenShot"><a href="#2-OpenShot" class="headerlink" title="2. OpenShot"></a>2. OpenShot</h3><p>Another free and open-source program, OpenShot, has the ability to give you high-quality output with minimal effort. The software includes all the basic functions like resizing, scaling, trimming, and audio mixing with real-time previews. Plus, it also incorporates features for animated-based keyframing and creating 2D animation with image sequencing.</p>
<p>Moreover, like the VSDC, there are also presets to give 3D effects like snowfall, text, and lens flares, and other effects to the video. Nonetheless, if you want to take these into your hand and need more flexibility over transition, effects, filters, and more then you will have to look elsewhere. Because although great, OpenShot does have gaps and excludes critical features, meaning if you want to give artistic effects and personalize the video as much as possible, OpenShot is not suitable for you.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vsdc-for-mac-2.jpg"
                      alt="openshot"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OpenShot user-friendly, intuitive interface enables users to utilize all the editing functions effortlessly.</li>
<li>The dedicated preview-video section allows you to view the edited video in real-time and see if everything is done perfectly or not.</li>
<li>Includes some basic 2D and 3D transition, plus it also includes filters and effects.</li>
<li>Audio equalizer lets you work on every aspect of the audio and tune the music finely.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many users have criticized the OpenShot video editor for lagging and crashing issues while editing high-resolution videos</li>
<li>Even after multiple requests from the users, OpenShot does not support GPU acceleration for encoding and decoding the video files.</li>
<li>Some critical features are missing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-Avidemux"><a href="#3-Avidemux" class="headerlink" title="3. Avidemux"></a>3. Avidemux</h3><p>Like VSDC, Avidemux is also a freeware that includes all the basic options to edit the video and is much suitable for beginner-level users. However, if you are intermediate or expert in video editing, Avidemux is not the one you need. The reason: Avidemux does have basic options like cutting, trimming, splitting, and more. Still, when it comes to sophisticated features like creative effects, transition, Avidemux does not have dedicated functions for that. Moreover, as usual for the video editors, the Timeline feature is also missing from the software.</p>
<p>Of course, in comparison to VSDC, Avidemux falls short. Because all it can do is the basic video editing, encoding, and de-noising. Other than that, it cannot boast about anything. Still, given the simple interface, Avidemux is perfect for newbies who do not have much experience with video editing. Be that as it may, if you are serious regarding video-editing, you should get a more powerful video editor on Mac.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="avidemux"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The simple interface allows even the naivest users to use the application to the fullest</li>
<li>The application has all the basic video-editing features like cutting, splitting, trimming</li>
<li>Avidemux is excellent for encoding options; one of the industry’s finest, in fact.</li>
<li>Sharpening and de-noising filters to give fine details to the video</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avidemux does not have advanced video-editing options like effects and transition</li>
<li>Lack the much important timeline feature</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part-3-Final-Words"><a href="#Part-3-Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Final Words"></a>Part 3: Final Words</h2><p>VSDC is a powerful and unique tool. The above-listed freeware like ShotCut, OpenShot, and Avidemux are good alternatives to it. But after reviewing several video editors — this is the closest we came to finding something similar to VSDC. And understanding that Mac users will need all the powerful functions that VSDC incorporates, Filmora for Mac that includes everything that VSDC has and more! The Filmora for Mac is also free to utilize, so you can simply download the software and edit videos like professionals.</p>

<h3 id="1-ShotCut-2"><a href="#1-ShotCut-2" class="headerlink" title="1. ShotCut"></a>1. ShotCut</h3><p>A simple, free, and open-source software that makes the video-making process straightforward. Filled with interesting ideas and powerful features, the greatest thing about ShotCut is that besides being free — it is regularly updated and maintained by the vendor. The interface has a three-panel view and adding media files is as simple as dragging and dropping.</p>
<p>The software also includes rich features like keyframing, color correction, transition and lets you edit up to 4K resolution video with ease. But unlike VSDC, ShotCut does not have multiple preset transition effects and includes only 24 basic wipe-in or out effects. Still, the software has sophisticated features like Chroma Key and allows you to utilize third-party addons for text and titles as the application does not have many of them.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight for a sophisticated video-editor</li>
<li>The interface is simple and convenient and allows you to customize the toggles as per your preference</li>
<li>Numerous output options — supports major formats and offers you to export the footage in any format</li>
<li>Completely free platforms plus cross-platform support</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The app does not allow you to create layers automatically.</li>
<li>It could be tough for a newbie to work on ShotCut.</li>
<li>The application takes too long to show the applied effects; even simple transition effects suffer from latency.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-OpenShot-2"><a href="#2-OpenShot-2" class="headerlink" title="2. OpenShot"></a>2. OpenShot</h3><p>Another free and open-source program, OpenShot, has the ability to give you high-quality output with minimal effort. The software includes all the basic functions like resizing, scaling, trimming, and audio mixing with real-time previews. Plus, it also incorporates features for animated-based keyframing and creating 2D animation with image sequencing.</p>
<p>Moreover, like the VSDC, there are also presets to give 3D effects like snowfall, text, and lens flares, and other effects to the video. Nonetheless, if you want to take these into your hand and need more flexibility over transition, effects, filters, and more then you will have to look elsewhere. Because although great, OpenShot does have gaps and excludes critical features, meaning if you want to give artistic effects and personalize the video as much as possible, OpenShot is not suitable for you.</p>

<li>OpenShot user-friendly, intuitive interface enables users to utilize all the editing functions effortlessly.</li>
<li>The dedicated preview-video section allows you to view the edited video in real-time and see if everything is done perfectly or not.</li>
<li>Includes some basic 2D and 3D transition, plus it also includes filters and effects.</li>
<li>Audio equalizer lets you work on every aspect of the audio and tune the music finely.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many users have criticized the OpenShot video editor for lagging and crashing issues while editing high-resolution videos</li>

<li>Some critical features are missing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-Avidemux-3"><a href="#3-Avidemux-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Avidemux"></a>3. Avidemux</h3><p>Like VSDC, Avidemux is also a freeware that includes all the basic options to edit the video and is much suitable for beginner-level users. However, if you are intermediate or expert in video editing, Avidemux is not the one you need. The reason: Avidemux does have basic options like cutting, trimming, splitting, and more. Still, when it comes to sophisticated features like creative effects, transition, Avidemux does not have dedicated functions for that. Moreover, as usual for the video editors, the Timeline feature is also missing from the software.</p>
<p>Of course, in comparison to VSDC, Avidemux falls short. Because all it can do is the basic video editing, encoding, and de-noising. Other than that, it cannot boast about anything. Still, given the simple interface, Avidemux is perfect for newbies who do not have much experience with video editing. Be that as it may, if you are serious regarding video-editing, you should get a more powerful video editor on Mac.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The simple interface allows even the naivest users to use the application to the fullest</li>
<li>The application has all the basic video-editing features like cutting, splitting, trimming</li>
<li>Avidemux is excellent for encoding options; one of the industry’s finest, in fact.</li>
<li>Sharpening and de-noising filters to give fine details to the video</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avidemux does not have advanced video-editing options like effects and transition</li>
<li>Lack the much important timeline feature</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part-3-Final-Words-3"><a href="#Part-3-Final-Words-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Final Words"></a>Part 3: Final Words</h2><p>VSDC is a powerful and unique tool. The above-listed freeware like ShotCut, OpenShot, and Avidemux are good alternatives to it. But after reviewing several video editors — this is the closest we came to finding something similar to VSDC. And understanding that Mac users will need all the powerful functions that VSDC incorporates, Filmora for Mac that includes everything that VSDC has and more! The Filmora for Mac is also free to utilize, so you can simply download the software and edit videos like professionals.</p>
