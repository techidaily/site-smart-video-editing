<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>

There’s no time limit to ownership, and it doesn’t ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>

<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?</strong></h2><p>The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.</p>
<p>Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.</p>

<p> Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There’s no time limit to ownership, and it doesn’t ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>

<p>While most videos nowadays are rectangular, and are recorded in either landscape or portrait orientation, there are some social media platforms that require the clips to be square shaped. If you want to upload your footages on such websites, it is essential to learn <strong>how to change video shape</strong>.</p>
<p>Another benefit of changing the shape of the recorded films is that they can be adjusted in limited amount of space, especially if they are to be posted on a website. Furthermore, some fancy designs such as star-shaped or circle-shaped videos attract more attention when used in digital marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>With that said, here you will learn <strong>how to change the shape of a video</strong> using one of the most advanced and versatile post-production tools, Wondershare Filmora.</p>

Given that, the aspect ratio can be modified to change the film shape from rectangle to square.</p>
<p>The instructions given below explain <strong>how to change video shape</strong> from rectangle to square in Wondershare Filmora:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import Video to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Launch Wondershare Filmora on your PC (a Windows 10 computer is used here), click the <strong>Add Files</strong> icon from the center of the <strong>Media</strong> window present at the upper-left section, and use the <strong>Open</strong> box that appears to select and import the source video to Filmora. Next, drag the video from the <strong>Media</strong> window to the Timeline, and select your preferred option when&#x2F;if the <strong>Project Setting</strong> confirmation box appears.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Change Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>Select the video in the Timeline, and click the <strong>Crop and Zoom</strong> icon from the upper-left area of the Timeline itself. On the <strong>Crop and Zoom</strong> window that opens next, select <strong>1:1</strong> from the <strong>Ratio</strong> drop-down list, and click <strong>OK</strong> to save the new setting.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Export the Video</strong></p>
<p>Click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center area of the interface, go to the <strong>Local</strong> tab on the <strong>Export</strong> box, select your preferred format from the <strong>Format</strong> list in the left pane, optionally click <strong>SETTINGS</strong> from the right window to make other adjustments if necessary, and click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right corner of the box.</p>

<p>You can learn <strong>how to change the shape of a video</strong> to an unlisted aspect ratio by following the instructions given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import the Video and Get to the Crop and Zoom Window</strong></p>
<p>Follow the method explained in <strong>Step 1</strong> of <strong>Part 1</strong> to import a video to Wondershare Filmora, and then add it to the Timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select Custom Ratio</strong></p>
<p>Select the video in the Timeline, and click the <strong>Crop and Zoom</strong> icon as explained earlier to open its window. Next, select <strong>Custom</strong> from the <strong>Ratio</strong> drop-down list to be able to crop the videos unproportionally.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Crop the Video Manually</strong></p>
<p>Drag the cropping handles from any one edge of the video. Repeat this process for all the four sides to select the area of interest. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Export the Video</strong></p>
<p>Follow the process explained in <strong>Step 3</strong> of <strong>Part 1</strong> to export the modified video.</p>
