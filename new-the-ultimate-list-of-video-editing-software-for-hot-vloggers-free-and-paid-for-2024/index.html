<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This non-linear editor seems to be a perfect solution for both established and aspiring vloggers because it offers a lot of video editing tools that are incredibly easy to use. Moreover, the software supports nearly all common image and<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which means that you can record your vlog entries with any digital camera. The best part is that VSDC enables its users to export videos in HD and 4K resolutions directly to YouTube. The only downside is that you can <strong>only install this vlog editor on a PC computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Anyone without previous knowledge can use this tool</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes errors appear when opening the software</p>
<h4 id="4-GoPro-Quik-Desktop-app"><a href="#4-GoPro-Quik-Desktop-app" class="headerlink" title="4.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>If you’re traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>It offers cloud storage</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Some good features are paid and expensive</p>
<h4 id="5-DaVinci-Resolve"><a href="#5-DaVinci-Resolve" class="headerlink" title="5. DaVinci Resolve"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve" >DaVinci Resolve <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free and premium version</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.</p>
<p>Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Complete video production tool with audio post-production options</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>4K video editing requires a premium version</p>
<h4 id="6-VN-Video-Editor"><a href="#6-VN-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="6. VN Video Editor"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vlognow.me/" >VN Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS</p>
<p>Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.</p>
<p>Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.</p>
<p>You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.</p>
<p>So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>No watermark and easy to use</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like</strong></p>
<p>No direct download link</p>
<p>Not meant for professional editors</p>
<h4 id="7-VideoPad"><a href="#7-VideoPad" class="headerlink" title="7.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.</p>
<p>In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>The free version includes lots of exciting features</p>
<p>Affordable upgrade</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version</p>
<h4 id="8-VideoProc-Vlogger"><a href="#8-VideoProc-Vlogger" class="headerlink" title="8.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>VideoProc Vlogger is specially designed for vlogging. It is great for both beginners and professionals. It has an easy interface and options with lots of unique features, including 28 motion presets, pan &amp; zoom, and motion cropping.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can also do color grading and color correction along with HSL color adjustment. In the same way, you can fix low light and overexposure and reduce noise.</p>
<p>A few more features of VideoProc Vlogger include fisheye removal, time-lapse, split screen, green screen, text addition, voice recording, audio extractor, and more.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>100% secure</p>
<p>Free tech – support</p>
<p>Video tutorials available</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Minor issues with clips splitting</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This non-linear editor seems to be a perfect solution for both established and aspiring vloggers because it offers a lot of video editing tools that are incredibly easy to use. Moreover, the software supports nearly all common image and<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which means that you can record your vlog entries with any digital camera. The best part is that VSDC enables its users to export videos in HD and 4K resolutions directly to YouTube. The only downside is that you can <strong>only install this vlog editor on a PC computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>

<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>If you’re traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>It offers cloud storage</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Some good features are paid and expensive</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.</p>
<p>Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Complete video production tool with audio post-production options</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>4K video editing requires a premium version</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS</p>
<p>Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.</p>
<p>Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.</p>
<p>You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.</p>
<p>So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>No watermark and easy to use</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like</strong></p>
<p>No direct download link</p>
<p>Not meant for professional editors</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.</p>
<p>In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>The free version includes lots of exciting features</p>
<p>Affordable upgrade</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>VideoProc Vlogger is specially designed for vlogging. It is great for both beginners and professionals. It has an easy interface and options with lots of unique features, including 28 motion presets, pan &amp; zoom, and motion cropping.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can also do color grading and color correction along with HSL color adjustment. In the same way, you can fix low light and overexposure and reduce noise.</p>
<p>A few more features of VideoProc Vlogger include fisheye removal, time-lapse, split screen, green screen, text addition, voice recording, audio extractor, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This non-linear editor seems to be a perfect solution for both established and aspiring vloggers because it offers a lot of video editing tools that are incredibly easy to use. Moreover, the software supports nearly all common image and<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which means that you can record your vlog entries with any digital camera. The best part is that VSDC enables its users to export videos in HD and 4K resolutions directly to YouTube. The only downside is that you can <strong>only install this vlog editor on a PC computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>

<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>

<h4 id="4-GoPro-Quik-Desktop-app-2"><a href="#4-GoPro-Quik-Desktop-app-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>If you’re traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>It offers cloud storage</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Some good features are paid and expensive</p>
<h4 id="5-DaVinci-Resolve-2"><a href="#5-DaVinci-Resolve-2" class="headerlink" title="5. DaVinci Resolve"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve" >DaVinci Resolve <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free and premium version</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.</p>
<p>Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Complete video production tool with audio post-production options</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>4K video editing requires a premium version</p>
<h4 id="6-VN-Video-Editor-2"><a href="#6-VN-Video-Editor-2" class="headerlink" title="6. VN Video Editor"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vlognow.me/" >VN Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS</p>
<p>Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.</p>
<p>Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.</p>
<p>You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.</p>
<p>So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>No watermark and easy to use</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like</strong></p>
<p>No direct download link</p>
<p>Not meant for professional editors</p>
<h4 id="7-VideoPad-2"><a href="#7-VideoPad-2" class="headerlink" title="7.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.</p>
<p>In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>The free version includes lots of exciting features</p>
<p>Affordable upgrade</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version</p>
<h4 id="8-VideoProc-Vlogger-2"><a href="#8-VideoProc-Vlogger-2" class="headerlink" title="8.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>VideoProc Vlogger is specially designed for vlogging. It is great for both beginners and professionals. It has an easy interface and options with lots of unique features, including 28 motion presets, pan &amp; zoom, and motion cropping.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can also do color grading and color correction along with HSL color adjustment. In the same way, you can fix low light and overexposure and reduce noise.</p>
<p>A few more features of VideoProc Vlogger include fisheye removal, time-lapse, split screen, green screen, text addition, voice recording, audio extractor, and more.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>100% secure</p>
<p>Free tech – support</p>
<p>Video tutorials available</p>

For instance, if you don’t have a lot of experience in the field and you’d just like to piece a few clips together, then there is no reason to spend extensive amounts of money on professional video editing software.</p>

<h4 id="3-VSDC-Free-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#3-VSDC-Free-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="3. VSDC Free Video Editor"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.videosoftdev.com/free-video-editor" >VSDC Free Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This non-linear editor seems to be a perfect solution for both established and aspiring vloggers because it offers a lot of video editing tools that are incredibly easy to use. Moreover, the software supports nearly all common image and<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which means that you can record your vlog entries with any digital camera. The best part is that VSDC enables its users to export videos in HD and 4K resolutions directly to YouTube. The only downside is that you can <strong>only install this vlog editor on a PC computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Anyone without previous knowledge can use this tool</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes errors appear when opening the software</p>
<h4 id="4-GoPro-Quik-Desktop-app-3"><a href="#4-GoPro-Quik-Desktop-app-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>If you’re traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>It offers cloud storage</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Some good features are paid and expensive</p>
<h4 id="5-DaVinci-Resolve-3"><a href="#5-DaVinci-Resolve-3" class="headerlink" title="5. DaVinci Resolve"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve" >DaVinci Resolve <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free and premium version</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.</p>
<p>Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Complete video production tool with audio post-production options</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>4K video editing requires a premium version</p>
<h4 id="6-VN-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#6-VN-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="6. VN Video Editor"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vlognow.me/" >VN Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS</p>
<p>Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.</p>
<p>Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.</p>
<p>You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.</p>
<p>So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>No watermark and easy to use</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like</strong></p>
<p>No direct download link</p>
<p>Not meant for professional editors</p>
<h4 id="7-VideoPad-3"><a href="#7-VideoPad-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.</p>
<p>In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>The free version includes lots of exciting features</p>
<p>Affordable upgrade</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version</p>
<h4 id="8-VideoProc-Vlogger-3"><a href="#8-VideoProc-Vlogger-3" class="headerlink" title="8.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>VideoProc Vlogger is specially designed for vlogging. It is great for both beginners and professionals. It has an easy interface and options with lots of unique features, including 28 motion presets, pan &amp; zoom, and motion cropping.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can also do color grading and color correction along with HSL color adjustment. In the same way, you can fix low light and overexposure and reduce noise.</p>
<p>A few more features of VideoProc Vlogger include fisheye removal, time-lapse, split screen, green screen, text addition, voice recording, audio extractor, and more.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>100% secure</p>
<p>Free tech – support</p>
<p>Video tutorials available</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Minor issues with clips splitting</p>

<li><strong>Black screen while playing video:</strong> During the video editing process, users can experience a black screen on the preview, but the timeline may display the video. This can waste their hours of video editing efforts.</li>

<h2 id="How-to-Reset-Final-Cut-Pro-X"><a href="#How-to-Reset-Final-Cut-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="How to Reset Final Cut Pro X?"></a>How to Reset Final Cut Pro X?</h2><p>Final Cut Pro X can be really exciting to use if you also get to know the solutions to reset the video editing tool. There can be several reasons as listed above due to which you may require resetting the tool. Here are a few common methods that can fix the problems and reset the software tool as a whole. We have explained the methods with the help of screenshots for your better understanding.</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Locating-the-Preferences"><a href="#Method-1-Locating-the-Preferences" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Locating the Preferences"></a>Method 1: Locating the Preferences</h3><p>You will require locating the preferences when the Final Cut Pro X keeps crashing. Usually, this program has five different locations where it stores preferences and settings, and that’s from where you can delete the right ones. Located in the library folder, you will find a sub-category of the root level library preferences folder containing the Final Cut Pro System Support folder.</p>
<p>The custom settings folder will contain the presets which you will have to delete. As soon as you find the right folder, you can begin trashing. You can drag the folders to the Trash and empty them then re-open the Final Cut Pro X to see if the problem is settled. If it isn’t, try deleting some more and keep checking the software tool.</p>
<h3 id="Method-2-Deleting-Render-Files"><a href="#Method-2-Deleting-Render-Files" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Deleting Render Files"></a>Method 2: Deleting Render Files</h3><p>Do remember to save your important files before you do this. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Click here to see How to Save Final Cut Pro Project the Right Way？ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>This can come in handy when your timeline does not share or render, or simply crash during playback of the rendered area. These render files in Final Cut Pro X seem to be particularly vulnerable to corruption. If you face any troubles during export or rendering, you should instead delete them in the first place. It should be your first action. In order to successfully do so, you can select the project in the browser and choose the file. After that, you can delete the generated project files.</p>
<p>You can begin deleting the files with just a few unused items, but if you feel that you face more trouble you can delete all the files instead. However, you will not have to delete optimized media or proxy. If the problem remains, you can delete the generated files from the Library or the event.</p>
<h3 id="Method-3-Transferring-Events-to-a-Fresh-Library-Folder"><a href="#Method-3-Transferring-Events-to-a-Fresh-Library-Folder" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Transferring Events to a Fresh Library Folder"></a>Method 3: Transferring Events to a Fresh Library Folder</h3><p>This method can be useful if the library corrupts. You should consider transferring your events to a freshly created Library. The majority of the time, this would resolve the problem. If you cannot open the Library, you can eliminate some specific generated items under the Library bundle’s root level. Ideally removing “Setting.plist” and “CurrentVersion.flexolibrary” are the safe options for removal, which can likely open the Library.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Word"><a href="#Final-Word" class="headerlink" title="Final Word"></a>Final Word</h2><p>Final Cut Pro X can be a very helpful video editing tool until it acts up. Regardless of the reasons for a crashing program, you should consider implementing any of the aforementioned methods to reset the editor, troubleshoot the problems, and seamlessly edit your videos in the long run.</p>

<p>Before we take the plunge to understand how we can prevent getting into trouble with the Final Cut Pro X in the first place, let’s explore when this tool needs to be reset. Here are a few reasons to reset Final Cut Pro X:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plugin malfunction:</strong> When the plugin i.e. the feature or effect for the video, is not in working condition, any user cannot edit the video as per their wish.</li>
<li><strong>Black screen while playing video:</strong> During the video editing process, users can experience a black screen on the preview, but the timeline may display the video. This can waste their hours of video editing efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Crashing FCPX:</strong> Oftentimes, the latest version of Final Cut Pro X can keep crashing because of the corrupted preferences. When users do not reset the preferences, it can corrupt the file and crash the video editor.</li>
<li><strong>Crashing Timeline:</strong> This can happen when the timeline does not render or&#x2F;and share due to which it can crash during playback of the rendered area.</li>
<li><strong>Troubling Library:</strong> The library may not open due to which even the event icon can be missing, and it may affect to share the project and render timelines that call for resetting.</li>
<li><strong>Odd Editing Operations:</strong> One can face strange editing operations and may not be able to share the project timeline and even render.</li>
<li><strong>A problem in Importing:</strong> When users cannot render or export project timeline, they may not be able to import the footage which would require resetting.</li>

There can be several reasons as listed above due to which you may require resetting the tool. Here are a few common methods that can fix the problems and reset the software tool as a whole. We have explained the methods with the help of screenshots for your better understanding.</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Locating-the-Preferences-1"><a href="#Method-1-Locating-the-Preferences-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Locating the Preferences"></a>Method 1: Locating the Preferences</h3><p>You will require locating the preferences when the Final Cut Pro X keeps crashing. Usually, this program has five different locations where it stores preferences and settings, and that’s from where you can delete the right ones. Located in the library folder, you will find a sub-category of the root level library preferences folder containing the Final Cut Pro System Support folder.</p>
<p>The custom settings folder will contain the presets which you will have to delete. As soon as you find the right folder, you can begin trashing. You can drag the folders to the Trash and empty them then re-open the Final Cut Pro X to see if the problem is settled. If it isn’t, try deleting some more and keep checking the software tool.</p>
<h3 id="Method-2-Deleting-Render-Files-1"><a href="#Method-2-Deleting-Render-Files-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Deleting Render Files"></a>Method 2: Deleting Render Files</h3><p>Do remember to save your important files before you do this. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Click here to see How to Save Final Cut Pro Project the Right Way？ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>This can come in handy when your timeline does not share or render, or simply crash during playback of the rendered area. These render files in Final Cut Pro X seem to be particularly vulnerable to corruption. If you face any troubles during export or rendering, you should instead delete them in the first place. It should be your first action. In order to successfully do so, you can select the project in the browser and choose the file. After that, you can delete the generated project files.</p>
<p>You can begin deleting the files with just a few unused items, but if you feel that you face more trouble you can delete all the files instead. However, you will not have to delete optimized media or proxy. If the problem remains, you can delete the generated files from the Library or the event.</p>
<h3 id="Method-3-Transferring-Events-to-a-Fresh-Library-Folder-1"><a href="#Method-3-Transferring-Events-to-a-Fresh-Library-Folder-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Transferring Events to a Fresh Library Folder"></a>Method 3: Transferring Events to a Fresh Library Folder</h3><p>This method can be useful if the library corrupts. You should consider transferring your events to a freshly created Library. The majority of the time, this would resolve the problem. If you cannot open the Library, you can eliminate some specific generated items under the Library bundle’s root level. Ideally removing “Setting.plist” and “CurrentVersion.flexolibrary” are the safe options for removal, which can likely open the Library.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Word-1"><a href="#Final-Word-1" class="headerlink" title="Final Word"></a>Final Word</h2><p>Final Cut Pro X can be a very helpful video editing tool until it acts up. Regardless of the reasons for a crashing program, you should consider implementing any of the aforementioned methods to reset the editor, troubleshoot the problems, and seamlessly edit your videos in the long run.</p>

<p>When you’re learning from a seasoned expert, it’s easy to feel left behind as they go through tools and features you’ve never heard of. On the other hand, the Totally Exposed channel puts such concerns to rest with one-of-a-kind lessons in which we learn with Neil, a novice who has never used FCP X before.</p>
<p>Importing, basic terminologies, cutting clips, and adding music, as well as adding effects, titles, and exporting the finished material, are all covered in this video. It’s more of a trawling movie than a fast instruction at over one hour long. However, it’s ideal for novice users who want to take things a little more slowly and absorb knowledge over time.</p>
<p><strong>Why recommend this channle?</strong></p>
<p>• Extensive yet still very well-paced for beginners.</p>
<p>• Amazing teaching skills.</p>
<p>However, all the video tutorials are quite long because FCPX is powerful but not easy to get started with. You can always choose Wondershare Filmora to boost your editing.</p>

                ></p>
<p>FCP.co is dedicated to all things video on the Mac, focusing on Final Cut Pro X video editing techniques and lessons. They’re continuously updated on the latest FCPX third-party plugins and filters (including many free effects). Unlike Apple’s FCPX user forum, this one is quite active and updated frequently.</p>
<h3 id="2-Apple-Support-Center"><a href="#2-Apple-Support-Center" class="headerlink" title="2.Apple Support Center"></a>2.<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/resources/" >Apple Support Center <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p>On Apple’s official website, the FCPX support community is active. If you have a specific query regarding the application, this is an excellent resource. The emphasis here is less on editing style, and skill since most content focuses on more technical FCPX software&#x2F;hardware concerns. It’s worth mentioning that if you contribute to the community by assisting other users with their problems rather than just asking questions, your editing karma will skyrocket!</p>

<p>FCPX.tv, with its motto “all things Final Cut Pro X,” is a one-stop shop for the most up-to-date advice and news on this software. An endless list of Final Cut Pro X requests (for future versions and upgrades), FCPX editing lessons, and documentation of known FCPX issues are just a few of the highlights. If you’re an FCPX power editor, this is a must-visit website.</p>
<h2 id="Part3-Is-Paid-Class-of-FCPX-Worth-For-Beginners"><a href="#Part3-Is-Paid-Class-of-FCPX-Worth-For-Beginners" class="headerlink" title="Part3: Is Paid Class of FCPX Worth For Beginners?"></a>Part3: Is Paid Class of FCPX Worth For Beginners?</h2><p>The last thing you want to do with your hectic schedule is sitting through hours of aimless video lessons. Buying Final Cut Pro lessons gives you the feel of having a personal trainer working alongside you. You can enroll in FCPX paid courses on Udemy and Coursera. Often a certificate of completion is available for download at the end of the course.</p>
<p>However, if you are a beginner, we won’t recommend you buy paid courses. There is unlimited free content related to Final Cut Pro available on YouTube and other websites that you can access without spending a penny.</p>
<p>When you have to spend too much money and energy on an editing tool, consider if it’s really worth it. Rather, you can always choose a much easier yet still powerful editor like Filmora to save your time for better editing.</p>

<p>FCPX.tv, with its motto “all things Final Cut Pro X,” is a one-stop shop for the most up-to-date advice and news on this software. An endless list of Final Cut Pro X requests (for future versions and upgrades), FCPX editing lessons, and documentation of known FCPX issues are just a few of the highlights. If you’re an FCPX power editor, this is a must-visit website.</p>

Buying Final Cut Pro lessons gives you the feel of having a personal trainer working alongside you. You can enroll in FCPX paid courses on Udemy and Coursera. Often a certificate of completion is available for download at the end of the course.</p>
<p>However, if you are a beginner, we won’t recommend you buy paid courses. There is unlimited free content related to Final Cut Pro available on YouTube and other websites that you can access without spending a penny.</p>
<p>When you have to spend too much money and energy on an editing tool, consider if it’s really worth it. Rather, you can always choose a much easier yet still powerful editor like Filmora to save your time for better editing.</p>

Buying Final Cut Pro lessons gives you the feel of having a personal trainer working alongside you. You can enroll in FCPX paid courses on Udemy and Coursera. Often a certificate of completion is available for download at the end of the course.</p>
<p>However, if you are a beginner, we won’t recommend you buy paid courses. There is unlimited free content related to Final Cut Pro available on YouTube and other websites that you can access without spending a penny.</p>
<p>When you have to spend too much money and energy on an editing tool, consider if it’s really worth it. Rather, you can always choose a much easier yet still powerful editor like Filmora to save your time for better editing.</p>

Your budget will not always be sufficient, and you will frequently find yourselves at a fork in the road when the funds are few. So, the good news for FCPX editors is that there is a slew of free plugins, including overlays, LUTs, flares, and titles, that are very excellent (and don’t seem like your dingus friend produced them). You can watch the tutorial course if you want to learn more about these free and paid plugins in all price ranges.</p>

If you’re new to FCPX and want to get started with video editing, you can join this FREE hour-long in-depth training that will get you up and running in no time!</p>

<p>When you’re learning from a seasoned expert, it’s easy to feel left behind as they go through tools and features you’ve never heard of. On the other hand, the Totally Exposed channel puts such concerns to rest with one-of-a-kind lessons in which we learn with Neil, a novice who has never used FCP X before.</p>
<p>Importing, basic terminologies, cutting clips, and adding music, as well as adding effects, titles, and exporting the finished material, are all covered in this video. It’s more of a trawling movie than a fast instruction at over one hour long. However, it’s ideal for novice users who want to take things a little more slowly and absorb knowledge over time.</p>
<p><strong>Why recommend this channle?</strong></p>
<p>• Extensive yet still very well-paced for beginners.</p>
<p>• Amazing teaching skills.</p>
<p>However, all the video tutorials are quite long because FCPX is powerful but not easy to get started with. You can always choose Wondershare Filmora to boost your editing.</p>

<p>FCP.co is dedicated to all things video on the Mac, focusing on Final Cut Pro X video editing techniques and lessons. They’re continuously updated on the latest FCPX third-party plugins and filters (including many free effects). Unlike Apple’s FCPX user forum, this one is quite active and updated frequently.</p>

                ></p>
<p>On Apple’s official website, the FCPX support community is active. If you have a specific query regarding the application, this is an excellent resource. The emphasis here is less on editing style, and skill since most content focuses on more technical FCPX software&#x2F;hardware concerns. It’s worth mentioning that if you contribute to the community by assisting other users with their problems rather than just asking questions, your editing karma will skyrocket!</p>
