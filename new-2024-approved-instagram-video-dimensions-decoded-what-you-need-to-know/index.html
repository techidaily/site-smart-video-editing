                ></p>
<p>1. The Social Network (2010)</p>
<p>Based on the rise of the phenomenon that we now know as Facebook, The Social Network starred Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. The movie performed well at the box office and was also positively received by movie critics.</p>
<p>The film won an Academy Award for Best Editing, collected by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. They used Final Cut Pro to edit the film, and one of the things they really like about the software is the ability to do multiple timelines. Final Cut Pro was also used in this movie to enable face replacement in a number of scenes. Two of the key characters in the movie are twins, and so the scenes were filmed with actors (who weren’t twins) and then the editing software was used to create the illusion that they were twins. Digital matte paintings was another feature of this movie that relied on the functionality of Final Cut Pro.</p>

                ></p>
<p>2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</p>
<p>This was the US adaptation of the earlier Swedish film of the same name - based on the novel by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the story is a crime thriller trying to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of a young girl from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

<p>3. John Carter (2011)</p>
<p>A science fiction adventure, this film performed so badly at the box office that it caused major financial problems for its studio Disney.</p>
<p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p>

<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

<p>7. No Country for Old Men (2007)</p>
<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>8. 300 (2007)</p>
<p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie was filmed with a super-imposition chroma key technique to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. Editing on the movie was by William Hoy.</p>
<p>To capture the graphic novel look and feel of the film’s images, editor Hoy used a number of the key Final Cut Pro features such as the adjustment layer and blending modes to create depth and mood. With the look and feel of this movie so dependent on the effects created, editor Hoy spent a lot of time debating what was being added visually to each shot and how this would impact the length and continuity of each scene.</p>

<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>10. Cold Mountain (2003)</p>
<p>This is an epic Civil War drama based on the novel by Charles Frazier. Starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger this was critically acclaimed and performed reasonably well at the box office.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p>
<p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions. Editor Murch believes that the use of Final Cut Pro on this movie indirected affected the ultimate creative outcome.

<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p>1. The Social Network (2010)</p>
<p>Based on the rise of the phenomenon that we now know as Facebook, The Social Network starred Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. The movie performed well at the box office and was also positively received by movie critics.</p>
<p>The film won an Academy Award for Best Editing, collected by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. They used Final Cut Pro to edit the film, and one of the things they really like about the software is the ability to do multiple timelines. Final Cut Pro was also used in this movie to enable face replacement in a number of scenes. Two of the key characters in the movie are twins, and so the scenes were filmed with actors (who weren’t twins) and then the editing software was used to create the illusion that they were twins. Digital matte paintings was another feature of this movie that relied on the functionality of Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</p>
<p>This was the US adaptation of the earlier Swedish film of the same name - based on the novel by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the story is a crime thriller trying to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of a young girl from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

<p>3. John Carter (2011)</p>
<p>A science fiction adventure, this film performed so badly at the box office that it caused major financial problems for its studio Disney.</p>
<p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p>

<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>8. 300 (2007)</p>
<p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie was filmed with a super-imposition chroma key technique to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. Editing on the movie was by William Hoy.</p>
<p>To capture the graphic novel look and feel of the film’s images, editor Hoy used a number of the key Final Cut Pro features such as the adjustment layer and blending modes to create depth and mood. With the look and feel of this movie so dependent on the effects created, editor Hoy spent a lot of time debating what was being added visually to each shot and how this would impact the length and continuity of each scene.</p>

<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>

                ></p>
<p>10. Cold Mountain (2003)</p>
<p>This is an epic Civil War drama based on the novel by Charles Frazier. Starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger this was critically acclaimed and performed reasonably well at the box office.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p>
<p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions. Editor Murch believes that the use of Final Cut Pro on this movie indirected affected the ultimate creative outcome. In particular, the use of the DVD authoring capabilities on Final Cut Pro meant that the editing team was able to look at the material more often, sharing it with more people, and changing the way that they looked at certain scenes.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p>Developed as video editing software that has been developed by Apple, Final Cut Pro began life as software designed to made simple video editing accessible for video hobbyists and independent filmmakers. However, in recent years the capabilities of Final Cut Pro have evolved significantly and we are now seeing major Hollywood movies also being edited with this software.</p>

                      alt="Movie made by FCP - the social network"
                ></p>
<p>1. The Social Network (2010)</p>
<p>Based on the rise of the phenomenon that we now know as Facebook, The Social Network starred Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. The movie performed well at the box office and was also positively received by movie critics.</p>
<p>The film won an Academy Award for Best Editing, collected by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. They used Final Cut Pro to edit the film, and one of the things they really like about the software is the ability to do multiple timelines. Final Cut Pro was also used in this movie to enable face replacement in a number of scenes. Two of the key characters in the movie are twins, and so the scenes were filmed with actors (who weren’t twins) and then the editing software was used to create the illusion that they were twins. Digital matte paintings was another feature of this movie that relied on the functionality of Final Cut Pro.</p>

                      alt="Movie made by FCP - The girl with dragon tattoo"
                ></p>
<p>2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</p>
<p>This was the US adaptation of the earlier Swedish film of the same name - based on the novel by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the story is a crime thriller trying to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of a young girl from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

                ></p>
<p>3. John Carter (2011)</p>
<p>A science fiction adventure, this film performed so badly at the box office that it caused major financial problems for its studio Disney.</p>
<p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p>

<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

                ></p>
<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

                ></p>
<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

                ></p>
<p>7. No Country for Old Men (2007)</p>
<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>8. 300 (2007)</p>
<p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie was filmed with a super-imposition chroma key technique to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. Editing on the movie was by William Hoy.</p>
<p>To capture the graphic novel look and feel of the film’s images, editor Hoy used a number of the key Final Cut Pro features such as the adjustment layer and blending modes to create depth and mood. With the look and feel of this movie so dependent on the effects created, editor Hoy spent a lot of time debating what was being added visually to each shot and how this would impact the length and continuity of each scene.</p>

<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p>
<p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions. Editor Murch believes that the use of Final Cut Pro on this movie indirected affected the ultimate creative outcome. In particular, the use of the DVD authoring capabilities on Final Cut Pro meant that the editing team was able to look at the material more often, sharing it with more people, and changing the way that they looked at certain scenes.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

We’ve decided to go very simple with this list, providing a brief description of all of the FREE <strong>MP3 Converters</strong> (<strong>Windows</strong>), a URL that will lead you to the website where you can get the converter, and an image that should show you how the converter’s interface looks like.</p>
<h3 id="01EaseUs-MobiMover"><a href="#01EaseUs-MobiMover" class="headerlink" title="01EaseUs MobiMover"></a>01<strong>EaseUs MobiMover</strong></h3><p>EaseUs MobiMover is an <strong>audio converter for Windows 10</strong> and 11 that you can use in order to easily convert videos (in various formats) into MP3 (as is shown in the image below. It’s a FREEmium software though — which means that it’s use is limited until you purchase the paid version of the software.</p>

<h3 id="02Freemake-Video-Converter"><a href="#02Freemake-Video-Converter" class="headerlink" title="02Freemake Video Converter"></a>02<strong>Freemake Video Converter</strong></h3><p>Freemake Video Converter is the first 100% FREE <strong>MP3 converter for Windows 10</strong> on this list! They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It’s a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<h3 id="03VSDC"><a href="#03VSDC" class="headerlink" title="03VSDC"></a>03<strong>VSDC</strong></h3><p>Much like Freemake, our next <strong>MP3 converter for Windows 10</strong> and 11, called VSDC, is completely FREE — as they run primarily on donations. That does mean that it’s not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an <strong>audio-video-converter for Windows 10</strong> (and vice versa.)</p>

<h3 id="04Convertio-co"><a href="#04Convertio-co" class="headerlink" title="04Convertio.co"></a>04<strong>Convertio.co</strong></h3><p>With Convertio.co, we break the mold a bit! This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="05Free-Convert"><a href="#05Free-Convert" class="headerlink" title="05Free Convert"></a>05<strong>Free Convert</strong></h3><p>Free Convert is another online <strong>MP3 convert for Windows 10</strong> users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you’ll have to pay for the premium version.</p>

<h3 id="06DVDVideoSoft"><a href="#06DVDVideoSoft" class="headerlink" title="06DVDVideoSoft"></a>06<strong>DVDVideoSoft</strong></h3><p>With DVDVideoSoft, we’re back to an <strong>audio-video converter for Windows 10</strong> that you have to download and install to work! It’s a FREEmium software too. That means that you’ll have to pay in order to unlock certain features. But, it works as a solid converter even without that.</p>

This list will be a little more detailed than the first, since there are many differences between the tools that we’ll be introducing (both FREE and PAID), but it should give you a clear idea on which would work best for you.</p>
<h3 id="01Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#01Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="01Wondershare Filmora"></a>01<strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong></h3><p>Operating System: Windows&#x2F;Mac</p>
<p>Today’s Best Deals: US$89.99 (one-time)</p>
<p>The first on our list is the <strong>MP3 editor Windows 10</strong> and Mac compatible, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> This is an advanced video editing software that you can use in order to work on just about any digital project — including, of course, editing your MP3 audio files.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Lots of editing tools for MP3 files</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Exports high-quality end-products</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> FREE to try, multiple-packages available</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Avoid:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Premium software (subscription&#x2F;one-time fee)</p>

<h3 id="02Audacity"><a href="#02Audacity" class="headerlink" title="02Audacity"></a>02<strong>Audacity</strong></h3><p>Operating System: Windows&#x2F;Mac&#x2F;Linux</p>
<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>Audacity is an <strong>MP3 editor (Windows 10</strong>, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> FREE, open-source software</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Advanced video and audio editing tools</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> MP3 trimming&#x2F;cutting feature</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Avoid:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Not updated as often</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Confusing interface</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Difficult to use for beginners</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: US$29.99</p>
<p>Next up is Ashampoo’s Music Studio 8! Here’s another freemium software that you can try for free — just to make sure it’s the tool that you’re looking for, but you’ll have to pay a price to use in its entirety! As you can see from the interface (shown in the image below) though, it’s quite the effective <strong>MP3 cutter for Windows 10</strong> (among other things). So, if that’s what you’re looking for, then it’s a good choice to consider.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Clean, modern interface</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Beginner-friendly editing tools</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> One-time fee only</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Avoid:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Freemium software (one-time payment required)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Available only for Windows!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Cannot support multiple tracks</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>As far as audio-editing goes, you’re probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio. As you can probably guess from the name, it is, primarily, an audio editing tool. Making it a good choice if that’s all you’re looking for in a software, as it certainly keeps things simpler.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Beginner-friendly audio editor</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Simple, clean interface</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Available for Windows&#x2F;Mac&#x2F;Linux</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Avoid:</strong></p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>Our next pick is another open-source, <strong>MP3 editor for Windows 10</strong>. It’s called Acoustica. And, as you can see from the image shared below, it’s a fairly advanced audio editing tool. You should note, however, that the newer versions of this product are PAID (only older models are free), which is the topic of our discussion today.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> FREE, open-source product</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Advanced audio editing tools</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Advanced exporting formats</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it’s certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below). But, the funky interface doesn’t mean that it won’t work for you! You never know, it might be exactly the kind that helps you zoom through your projects more quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> FREE, open-source software</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Available for Windows&#x2F;Mac&#x2F;Linux users</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Advanced audio editing</p>

This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we’ll be focusing on <strong>MP3 players for Windows 10</strong> only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)</p>
<h3 id="01iTunes"><a href="#01iTunes" class="headerlink" title="01iTunes"></a>01<strong>iTunes</strong></h3><p>Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong> users. After all, it’s interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren’t aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn’t like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="02Groove-Music"><a href="#02Groove-Music" class="headerlink" title="02Groove Music"></a>02<strong>Groove Music</strong></h3><p>Groove Music is a local <strong>Mp3 player for Windows 10</strong> that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that’s what you want.)</p>

<h3 id="03Macgo-Media-Player"><a href="#03Macgo-Media-Player" class="headerlink" title="03Macgo Media Player"></a>03<strong>Macgo Media Player</strong></h3><p>Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong>, but it can work for that purpose if that’s all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it’s FREE so you don’t have to worry about paying in order to use it.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="04PowerDVD"><a href="#04PowerDVD" class="headerlink" title="04PowerDVD"></a>04<strong>PowerDVD</strong></h3><p>Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a <strong>MP3 Player for Windows 10</strong> users, but it works just as well if all you’re looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you’ve converted or trimmed!</p>

<h3 id="05Musicbee"><a href="#05Musicbee" class="headerlink" title="05Musicbee"></a>05<strong>Musicbee</strong></h3><p>We’re back to strictly <strong>MP3 players for Windows</strong> with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It’s also useful for organizing your media collection!</p>

(Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)</p>

Start!"></a>01<strong>Step 1: Launch MP3 Cutter for Windows 10! Start!</strong></h3><p>First, launch the <strong>MP3 cutter for Windows 10</strong> that you downloaded.</p>
<p>For this example, we’ll be using Joyoshare Media Cutter. And, the way to start is to select the “Open” button, which will prompt you to choose which audio you want to cut.</p>

<h3 id="01EaseUs-MobiMover-1"><a href="#01EaseUs-MobiMover-1" class="headerlink" title="01EaseUs MobiMover"></a>01<strong>EaseUs MobiMover</strong></h3><p>EaseUs MobiMover is an <strong>audio converter for Windows 10</strong> and 11 that you can use in order to easily convert videos (in various formats) into MP3 (as is shown in the image below. It’s a FREEmium software though — which means that it’s use is limited until you purchase the paid version of the software.</p>

They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It’s a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)</p>

<h3 id="03VSDC-1"><a href="#03VSDC-1" class="headerlink" title="03VSDC"></a>03<strong>VSDC</strong></h3><p>Much like Freemake, our next <strong>MP3 converter for Windows 10</strong> and 11, called VSDC, is completely FREE — as they run primarily on donations. That does mean that it’s not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an <strong>audio-video-converter for Windows 10</strong> (and vice versa.)</p>

This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!</p>

<h3 id="05Free-Convert-1"><a href="#05Free-Convert-1" class="headerlink" title="05Free Convert"></a>05<strong>Free Convert</strong></h3><p>Free Convert is another online <strong>MP3 convert for Windows 10</strong> users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you’ll have to pay for the premium version.</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>Audacity is an <strong>MP3 editor (Windows 10</strong>, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> FREE, open-source software</p>

Here’s another freemium software that you can try for free — just to make sure it’s the tool that you’re looking for, but you’ll have to pay a price to use in its entirety! As you can see from the interface (shown in the image below) though, it’s quite the effective <strong>MP3 cutter for Windows 10</strong> (among other things). So, if that’s what you’re looking for, then it’s a good choice to consider.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>

<p>As far as audio-editing goes, you’re probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio.

<p>Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it’s certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below).

<h3 id="01iTunes-1"><a href="#01iTunes-1" class="headerlink" title="01iTunes"></a>01<strong>iTunes</strong></h3><p>Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong> users. After all, it’s interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren’t aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn’t like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)</p>

<h3 id="02Groove-Music-1"><a href="#02Groove-Music-1" class="headerlink" title="02Groove Music"></a>02<strong>Groove Music</strong></h3><p>Groove Music is a local <strong>Mp3 player for Windows 10</strong> that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that’s what you want.)</p>

<h3 id="03Macgo-Media-Player-1"><a href="#03Macgo-Media-Player-1" class="headerlink" title="03Macgo Media Player"></a>03<strong>Macgo Media Player</strong></h3><p>Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong>, but it can work for that purpose if that’s all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it’s FREE so you don’t have to worry about paying in order to use it.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="04PowerDVD-1"><a href="#04PowerDVD-1" class="headerlink" title="04PowerDVD"></a>04<strong>PowerDVD</strong></h3><p>Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a <strong>MP3 Player for Windows 10</strong> users, but it works just as well if all you’re looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you’ve converted or trimmed!</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<h3 id="05Musicbee-1"><a href="#05Musicbee-1" class="headerlink" title="05Musicbee"></a>05<strong>Musicbee</strong></h3><p>We’re back to strictly <strong>MP3 players for Windows</strong> with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It’s also useful for organizing your media collection!</p>

(Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)</p>

Start!"></a>01<strong>Step 1: Launch MP3 Cutter for Windows 10! Start!</strong></h3><p>First, launch the <strong>MP3 cutter for Windows 10</strong> that you downloaded.</p>
<p>For this example, we’ll be using Joyoshare Media Cutter. And, the way to start is to select the “Open” button, which will prompt you to choose which audio you want to cut.</p>

(Most <strong>MP3 cutters for Windows 10</strong> offers a variety for you to choose from).</p>

The first is the select and trim mode, which is shown in the image below! For this, you use the sliders provider to select which portion of the audio you want to keep!</p>

This will allow you to pinpoint the best place to cut your audio!</p>

<p>With Joyoshare, the method of doing this is to select the “Start” button, which will prompt the trimmer to begin cutting the audio.</p>

<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-5"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-5" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> There are multiple <strong>MP3 converters for Windows</strong> and Mac that you can use in order to convert videos to an audio file that you can use for certain projects.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want your finished project to sound clean, you’ll probably need a functional audio editor for that! And, for this matter, we recommend advanced video editing software like Filmora Pro.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Just in case you want to review what your converted audio sounds like, consider one of the audio players that are available for Windows and Mac!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you find that your audio needs some trimming, a quick trim with an audio cutter should do the trick. It’s very simple to do!</p>

We’ve decided to go very simple with this list, providing a brief description of all of the FREE <strong>MP3 Converters</strong> (<strong>Windows</strong>), a URL that will lead you to the website where you can get the converter, and an image that should show you how the converter’s interface looks like.</p>
<h3 id="01EaseUs-MobiMover-2"><a href="#01EaseUs-MobiMover-2" class="headerlink" title="01EaseUs MobiMover"></a>01<strong>EaseUs MobiMover</strong></h3><p>EaseUs MobiMover is an <strong>audio converter for Windows 10</strong> and 11 that you can use in order to easily convert videos (in various formats) into MP3 (as is shown in the image below. It’s a FREEmium software though — which means that it’s use is limited until you purchase the paid version of the software.</p>

<h3 id="02Freemake-Video-Converter-2"><a href="#02Freemake-Video-Converter-2" class="headerlink" title="02Freemake Video Converter"></a>02<strong>Freemake Video Converter</strong></h3><p>Freemake Video Converter is the first 100% FREE <strong>MP3 converter for Windows 10</strong> on this list! They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It’s a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)</p>

<h3 id="03VSDC-2"><a href="#03VSDC-2" class="headerlink" title="03VSDC"></a>03<strong>VSDC</strong></h3><p>Much like Freemake, our next <strong>MP3 converter for Windows 10</strong> and 11, called VSDC, is completely FREE — as they run primarily on donations. That does mean that it’s not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an <strong>audio-video-converter for Windows 10</strong> (and vice versa.)</p>

This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!</p>

<h3 id="05Free-Convert-2"><a href="#05Free-Convert-2" class="headerlink" title="05Free Convert"></a>05<strong>Free Convert</strong></h3><p>Free Convert is another online <strong>MP3 convert for Windows 10</strong> users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you’ll have to pay for the premium version.</p>

It’s a FREEmium software too. That means that you’ll have to pay in order to unlock certain features. But, it works as a solid converter even without that.</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>Audacity is an <strong>MP3 editor (Windows 10</strong>, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> FREE, open-source software</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Advanced video and audio editing tools</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> MP3 trimming&#x2F;cutting feature</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Avoid:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Not updated as often</p>

<p>Next up is Ashampoo’s Music Studio 8!

As you can see from the interface (shown in the image below) though, it’s quite the effective <strong>MP3 cutter for Windows 10</strong> (among other things). So, if that’s what you’re looking for, then it’s a good choice to consider.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Clean, modern interface</p>

<p>Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it’s certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below).

This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we’ll be focusing on <strong>MP3 players for Windows 10</strong> only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)</p>
<h3 id="01iTunes-2"><a href="#01iTunes-2" class="headerlink" title="01iTunes"></a>01<strong>iTunes</strong></h3><p>Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong> users. After all, it’s interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren’t aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn’t like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)</p>

<h3 id="02Groove-Music-2"><a href="#02Groove-Music-2" class="headerlink" title="02Groove Music"></a>02<strong>Groove Music</strong></h3><p>Groove Music is a local <strong>Mp3 player for Windows 10</strong> that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that’s what you want.)</p>

<h3 id="03Macgo-Media-Player-2"><a href="#03Macgo-Media-Player-2" class="headerlink" title="03Macgo Media Player"></a>03<strong>Macgo Media Player</strong></h3><p>Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong>, but it can work for that purpose if that’s all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it’s FREE so you don’t have to worry about paying in order to use it.</p>

<h3 id="04PowerDVD-2"><a href="#04PowerDVD-2" class="headerlink" title="04PowerDVD"></a>04<strong>PowerDVD</strong></h3><p>Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a <strong>MP3 Player for Windows 10</strong> users, but it works just as well if all you’re looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you’ve converted or trimmed!</p>

<h3 id="05Musicbee-2"><a href="#05Musicbee-2" class="headerlink" title="05Musicbee"></a>05<strong>Musicbee</strong></h3><p>We’re back to strictly <strong>MP3 players for Windows</strong> with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It’s also useful for organizing your media collection!</p>

This will allow you to pinpoint the best place to cut your audio!</p>

They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It’s a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)</p>

That does mean that it’s not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an <strong>audio-video-converter for Windows 10</strong> (and vice versa.)</p>

This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!</p>

<h3 id="05Free-Convert-3"><a href="#05Free-Convert-3" class="headerlink" title="05Free Convert"></a>05<strong>Free Convert</strong></h3><p>Free Convert is another online <strong>MP3 convert for Windows 10</strong> users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you’ll have to pay for the premium version.</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>Audacity is an <strong>MP3 editor (Windows 10</strong>, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> FREE, open-source software</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Advanced video and audio editing tools</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> MP3 trimming&#x2F;cutting feature</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Avoid:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Not updated as often</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Confusing interface</p>

<p>Next up is Ashampoo’s Music Studio 8! Here’s another freemium software that you can try for free — just to make sure it’s the tool that you’re looking for, but you’ll have to pay a price to use in its entirety! As you can see from the interface (shown in the image below) though, it’s quite the effective <strong>MP3 cutter for Windows 10</strong> (among other things). So, if that’s what you’re looking for, then it’s a good choice to consider.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Clean, modern interface</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Beginner-friendly editing tools</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>As far as audio-editing goes, you’re probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio. As you can probably guess from the name, it is, primarily, an audio editing tool. Making it a good choice if that’s all you’re looking for in a software, as it certainly keeps things simpler.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Beginner-friendly audio editor</p>

<p>Our next pick is another open-source, <strong>MP3 editor for Windows 10</strong>. It’s called Acoustica. And, as you can see from the image shared below, it’s a fairly advanced audio editing tool. You should note, however, that the newer versions of this product are PAID (only older models are free), which is the topic of our discussion today.</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it’s certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below). But, the funky interface doesn’t mean that it won’t work for you! You never know, it might be exactly the kind that helps you zoom through your projects more quickly.</p>

This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we’ll be focusing on <strong>MP3 players for Windows 10</strong> only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)</p>
<h3 id="01iTunes-3"><a href="#01iTunes-3" class="headerlink" title="01iTunes"></a>01<strong>iTunes</strong></h3><p>Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong> users. After all, it’s interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren’t aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn’t like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)</p>

<h3 id="02Groove-Music-3"><a href="#02Groove-Music-3" class="headerlink" title="02Groove Music"></a>02<strong>Groove Music</strong></h3><p>Groove Music is a local <strong>Mp3 player for Windows 10</strong> that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that’s what you want.)</p>

<h3 id="03Macgo-Media-Player-3"><a href="#03Macgo-Media-Player-3" class="headerlink" title="03Macgo Media Player"></a>03<strong>Macgo Media Player</strong></h3><p>Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong>, but it can work for that purpose if that’s all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it’s FREE so you don’t have to worry about paying in order to use it.</p>

<h3 id="04PowerDVD-3"><a href="#04PowerDVD-3" class="headerlink" title="04PowerDVD"></a>04<strong>PowerDVD</strong></h3><p>Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a <strong>MP3 Player for Windows 10</strong> users, but it works just as well if all you’re looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you’ve converted or trimmed!</p>

<h3 id="05Musicbee-3"><a href="#05Musicbee-3" class="headerlink" title="05Musicbee"></a>05<strong>Musicbee</strong></h3><p>We’re back to strictly <strong>MP3 players for Windows</strong> with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It’s also useful for organizing your media collection!</p>

(Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)</p>

<p>For this example, we’ll be using Joyoshare Media Cutter. And, the way to start is to select the “Open” button, which will prompt you to choose which audio you want to cut.</p>

This will allow you to pinpoint the best place to cut your audio!</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want your finished project to sound clean, you’ll probably need a functional audio editor for that! And, for this matter, we recommend advanced video editing software like Filmora Pro.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Just in case you want to review what your converted audio sounds like, consider one of the audio players that are available for Windows and Mac!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you find that your audio needs some trimming, a quick trim with an audio cutter should do the trick. It’s very simple to do!</p>
