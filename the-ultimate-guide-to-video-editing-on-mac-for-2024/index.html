In this article, we’ve compiled a list of the best <strong>Apple</strong> <strong>video</strong> <strong>editing</strong> software on the market right now, including free, freemium, and premium solutions.</p>
<p>With these apps, you can modify videos on your smartphones or computers easily. And if you’ve invested in an iPhone 13 Pro or iPhone 13 Pro Max that can capture video in the high-resolution ProRes standard, you’ll find reliable software to make the most of your video. We’ll go over which applications are excellent for specific chores and provide statistics to help you discover the best match. Let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="Apple-Apps-for-Video-Editing-You-Should-Try"><a href="#Apple-Apps-for-Video-Editing-You-Should-Try" class="headerlink" title="Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try"></a>Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try</h2><p>In today’s world, photos and videos are an integral part of everyone’s life. Mobile phones, laptops, and cameras may all be used to capture them. But, it might not be easy to organize and decorate them according to one’s unique preferences. Fortunately, there are several tools available to help Apple users with these tasks.</p>
<p>In the following part, I will introduce 5 best apple video editing software, including its unique features listed.</p>
<h3 id="1-Photos"><a href="#1-Photos" class="headerlink" title="1. Photos"></a>1. Photos</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;iPadOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>The number one on our list is the Photos app. It’s among the most well-known application for video editing enthusiasts in the iOS community. This is an application mostly used by professional designers and developers who are into the video editing profession.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with Photos App?</strong></p>
<p>Apple Inc. created Photos, a picture storage and editing program. Its main features are its simplicity and ease of usage. Its very name is a lovely and obvious indication of its use. Since 2015, this Mac picture editing app has been offered for OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 and tvOS v.10.</p>
<p>Filters and Smart Sliders are among the editing tools available in this program. It also has the Mark-up tool that allows you to <strong>add text</strong>, shapes, and doodles, as well as signatures. What’s more, you can <strong>rotate, crop and auto enhance</strong> videos in this app as well. Like photos editing, if you are not satisfied with the editing, you can tap <strong>Revert</strong> to restore to the original version.</p>
<p>If you are using the Photos app on iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, you can <strong>adjust the focus points and the depth of the field</strong> in Cinematic mode to make a cinematic-looking video easily.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit Videos Anywhere with iCloud Photo Library</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The connection with iCloud Picture Library is where Photos outperforms every other Mac image editing tool. This fantastic feature allows users to fill out their libraries rather than their devices. This is accomplished by syncing photographs and videos across all Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, MacBook and Apple Watch.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moments</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Photos employs Moments as an organizer, which may be used to build categories and years. Moments are a mix of the photo’s time and location information. Furthermore, facial recognition enables users to create groups based on a person, among other things.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Themes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Themes, which allow users to make calendars, picture albums, and other projects, complement the modifying and organizing capabilities. The program also provides printing capabilities for professional results.</p>
<h3 id="2-QuickTime-Player"><a href="#2-QuickTime-Player" class="headerlink" title="2. QuickTime Player"></a>2. QuickTime Player</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;iPad</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>Next on our list is the QuickTime Player that lets you do almost whatever you want to do with your videos and pictures. The app is built to support both beginners and professionals. However, we would lean more towards beginners because most professionals today prefer apps like iMovie or Final Cut Pro. But that’s not to say this one doesn’t have excellent features to offer.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with QuickTime Player App?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trim, Combine,</strong> <strong>Rotate, Split MOV Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone wants to make their lengthy videos short. QuickTime allows you to do precisely that with its trimming feature. Make your videos short and catchy with this feature. Further, you can combine two videos to make one excellent video for your presentation. The app also allows you to split different videos and combine them to produce more quality content.</p>
<ul>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is aspect ratio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen’s width will be almost twice as high as its height.</p>
<p>However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don’t miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the<strong>16*9 aspect ratio calculator.</strong></p>
<p>Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.</p>
<p>Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>The most significant similarity is the aspect ratio of 16:9. The 16:9 ratio dates back to 2009, when the ratio introduced was declared to be used globally. To prove it, take a minute and check the aspect ratios of your television screen or smartphone. Also, confirm the next time you go to the cinema to watch a movie.</p>
<p>You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.</p>
<p>The<strong>16 * 9 aspect ratio</strong>calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Top-16-9-resolutions"><a href="#Part-3-Top-16-9-resolutions" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Top 16:9 resolutions"></a>Part 3 <strong>Top 16:9 resolutions</strong></h2><p>These are the most common resolutions that are available. The units are in pixels, in descending order.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 15360×8640 (16K UHD)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 7680 × 4320 (8K UHD)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 5120 × 2880 (5K)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3840 × 2160 (4K UHD)</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?"></a>Part 4 <strong>How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>First, let’s look at the correct pronunciation of the ratio. You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.</p>
<p>Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The<strong>16*9 ratio calculator</strong>is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920&#x2F;1080 equals 16:9.</p>
<p>First, here’s the formula that we will use in this section.</p>
<p>Width (W) &#x2F;Height (H) &#x3D; 1.778</p>
<p>Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.</p>
<p>1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>32&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>H &#x3D;32 × 9&#x2F;16</p>
<p>H &#x3D; 18</p>
<p>Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.</p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<p>Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W&#x2F;720 &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W &#x3D; 730 × 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-use-an-aspect-ratio-calculator"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-use-an-aspect-ratio-calculator" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to use an aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 5 <strong>How to use an aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>These calculations may be easy when you’re used to them. Not interested in many calculations? Use the online aspect ratio calculator instead. That will make it easier and save on time. You will only need to have the width and height of the image that if needed. The 16 *9 ratio calculator will give the <strong>remaining distance.</strong></p>
<p>Using the calculator is the most preferred method because it is very precise. Supposing you don’t have any idea about the width or height of your image, just key in the aspect ratio and wait for an instant answer. The aspect ratio will still give the same answer, but the calculator is convenient.</p>
<p>The better part, this calculator provides calculations for landscape and portrait orientation for images. Follow these steps to use the calculator:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/" >https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter units of width and height in the respective tabs provided and instantly get your aspect ratio.</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?"></a>Part 4 <strong>How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>First, let’s look at the correct pronunciation of the ratio. You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.</p>
<p>Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The<strong>16*9 ratio calculator</strong>is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920&#x2F;1080 equals 16:9.</p>
<p>First, here’s the formula that we will use in this section.</p>
<p>Width (W) &#x2F;Height (H) &#x3D; 1.778</p>
<p>Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.</p>
<p>1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>32&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>H &#x3D;32 × 9&#x2F;16</p>
<p>H &#x3D; 18</p>
<p>Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.</p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<p>Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W&#x2F;720 &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W &#x3D; 730 × 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.</p>

<p>Using the calculator is the most preferred method because it is very precise. Supposing you don’t have any idea about the width or height of your image, just key in the aspect ratio and wait for an instant answer. The aspect ratio will still give the same answer, but the calculator is convenient.</p>

When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen’s width will be almost twice as high as its height.</p>
<p>However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don’t miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the<strong>16*9 aspect ratio calculator.</strong></p>
<p>Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is aspect ratio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen’s width will be almost twice as high as its height.</p>
<p>However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don’t miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the<strong>16*9 aspect ratio calculator.</strong></p>
<p>Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.</p>
<p>Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>The most significant similarity is the aspect ratio of 16:9. The 16:9 ratio dates back to 2009, when the ratio introduced was declared to be used globally. To prove it, take a minute and check the aspect ratios of your television screen or smartphone. Also, confirm the next time you go to the cinema to watch a movie.</p>
<p>You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.</p>
<p>The<strong>16 * 9 aspect ratio</strong>calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> 7680 × 4320 (8K UHD)</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?"></a>Part 4 <strong>How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>First, let’s look at the correct pronunciation of the ratio. You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.</p>
<p>Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The<strong>16*9 ratio calculator</strong>is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920&#x2F;1080 equals 16:9.</p>
<p>First, here’s the formula that we will use in this section.</p>
<p>Width (W) &#x2F;Height (H) &#x3D; 1.778</p>
<p>Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.</p>
<p>1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>32&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>H &#x3D;32 × 9&#x2F;16</p>
<p>H &#x3D; 18</p>
<p>Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.</p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<p>Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W&#x2F;720 &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W &#x3D; 730 × 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-use-an-aspect-ratio-calculator-3"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-use-an-aspect-ratio-calculator-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to use an aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 5 <strong>How to use an aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>These calculations may be easy when you’re used to them. Not interested in many calculations? Use the online aspect ratio calculator instead. That will make it easier and save on time. You will only need to have the width and height of the image that if needed. The 16 *9 ratio calculator will give the <strong>remaining distance.</strong></p>
<p>Using the calculator is the most preferred method because it is very precise. Supposing you don’t have any idea about the width or height of your image, just key in the aspect ratio and wait for an instant answer. The aspect ratio will still give the same answer, but the calculator is convenient.</p>
<p>The better part, this calculator provides calculations for landscape and portrait orientation for images. Follow these steps to use the calculator:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/" >https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter units of width and height in the respective tabs provided and instantly get your aspect ratio.</p>
