<p>Watching the time pass by in front of our eyes is mesmerizing. The fast forwarded scenes of beautiful sunsets, busy streets and all other types of vistas can be found anywhere from Holywood movies to YouTube videos. You don’t need professional camera equipment if you want to create time-lapse videos you can share on your social media accounts because there are plenty of apps that let you create these types of videos directly from your Smartphones. So, in this article, we are going to introduce you to some of the best time-lapse apps for iPhone and Android devices in 2020.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Time-Lapse-Apps-for-Android-and-iPhone-Devices-in-2021"><a href="#Best-Time-Lapse-Apps-for-Android-and-iPhone-Devices-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="Best Time-Lapse Apps for Android and iPhone Devices in 2021"></a>Best Time-Lapse Apps for Android and iPhone Devices in 2021</h2><p>The quality of your time-lapse video doesn’t depend only on the number of tools an app offers, which is why you must do everything in your power to record the footage that doesn’t contain camera shakes or any other common mistakes. With that being said, let’s take a look at the five best time-lapse apps you can find on GooglePlay or on the AppStore.</p>
<h4 id="1-Microsoft-Hyperlapse-Mobile"><a href="#1-Microsoft-Hyperlapse-Mobile" class="headerlink" title="1. Microsoft Hyperlapse Mobile"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.hyperlapsemobile&hl=en" >Microsoft Hyperlapse Mobile <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Android 4.4 or later</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.2</p>
<p>This Android-based application makes the creation of time-lapse videos look easy. You just have to select the speed at which you want to record a video, choose between 720p and 1080p resolutions and hit the record button. The app lets you increase the video’s speed up to 32 times, enabling you to create seamless time-lapses, although the video stabilization feature is only available if you’re recording a video at a normal speed. That is why you must ensure that your phone is perfectly stable while the recording is in progress if you want to create a smooth time-lapse. Microsoft Hyperlapse Mobile lets you share your creations on Instagram, Facebook, and other popular social media networks or save the time-lapse you’ve created to your phone’s SD card.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS 9.0 or later</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.1</p>
<p>This is a video editing app that doesn’t offer video recording options. However, if you already have the footage you’d like to turn into a time-lapse video, Slo Mo time lapse vid edit.or may be one of the best options you have. Besides creating slow motion and time-lapse videos, you can also use this app to enhance the colors in the footage you’re editing, crop or trim video clips and add customized text overlays to the videos. The app also features a wide spectrum of filters and allows you to add sound effects or music to the video you’re working on. Keep in mind that you have to make an in-app purchase if you want to remove the watermark from your videos or if you want to export your time-lapse and slow-motion videos in Full HD resolution.</p>

<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.1 on AppStore, 4.3 on Google Play</p>
<p>The seemingly endless list of options the Lapse It Pro offers makes it a perfect choice for all iPhone and Android users who want to speed up the footage they are recording up to 240 times. The app can be used in both Auto and Manual modes, which means that you can control ISO, Exposure or White Balance values while a recording session is still in progress. In case you don’t want to take photos or record videos with Lapse It Pro, you can import already existing footage into the app and turn it into a stunning time-lapse.

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Move your fingers upward on the iPhone screen to brighten the scene when you begin filming. This may be done at any moment while the video is being recorded.</p>

<p><strong>Can people say for sure that’s 4k and that’s 1080p?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is <strong>Yes</strong>, that there is no significant difference in both resolutions but while using a 65 inches screen the difference becomes clear, and as you go up in the sizes it gets more prominent.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Still, there are some pros and cons to both resolutions.</p>
<p>So do not wait…</p>
<p>Let us dive into the detail:</p>
<h3 id="What-is-a-4k"><a href="#What-is-a-4k" class="headerlink" title="What is a 4k?"></a>What is a 4k?</h3><p>As its name implies, it has almost 4000 pixels where it has <strong>3840 x 2160px</strong> or <strong>4096 x 2160</strong> horizontally and vertically and <strong>16:9</strong> is the Resolution. 4k presents clear and sharp graphics who loves to watch clear picture quality. It is commonly used in theaters and movies but it has also become common in residential use these days.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="4k"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When it comes to resolution 4k is always a better choice as it has 4 times more data than 1080p which means it has good picture quality. Its pixels are much smaller and it provides detailed information about the picture.</li>
<li>It allows you to crop and scale without pixelating your video.</li>
<li>It can be downscaled. Downscaling means converting the video to a low resolution and still achieving better video quality.</li>
<li>If you are a professional video editor, you can charge more for 4k videos.<br><strong>Cons</strong></li>
<li>It occupies more space on your camera.</li>
<li>It is harder to record.</li>
<li>It takes up a big space in memory so it is harder to edit.</li>
<li>There is limited content for 4k videos.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What-is-a1080p"><a href="#What-is-a1080p" class="headerlink" title="What is a1080p?"></a>What is a1080p?</h3><p>As its name implies, it has almost 1000 pixels where it has <strong>1920 x 1080px</strong> horizontally and vertically and <strong>16:9</strong> is the Resolution. It is also known as Full HD or FHD.<br><img

                      alt="1080"
                ><br><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can edit and shoot your videos on an average laptop or camera even you can use your cell phone.</li>
<li>It is most preferable in shooting slow-motion videos.</li>
<li>It has better features in terms of FPS (frame rate per second).</li>
<li>It has a much better focus than 4k.</li>
<li>Most people use 1080p laptops and devices and 4k video would also be converted into 1080p.</li>
<li>1080p is more economical if you have a low budget. <strong>Cons</strong></li>
<li>Its pixels are not too small and the images are not sharper.</li>
<li>It gives a little low-quality video or image. The picture quality beats resolution.</li>
<li>You cannot scale and crop your video as it will ruin your video. You can see the result in the screenshot below.<br><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="scale"
                ><br>In the picture above, you can clearly observe that the 4k image has sharp results around the edges of the image and written text. Hence it is clearer than 1080p.</li>

<p>We have been familiar with 1080p resolution for quite some years. However, HD has taken a new leap with ‘4k UHD’ offering higher than 1080p resolution. 4k UHD is mainly used in digital cinema with 4096x2160 as its pixel resolution or Ultra HD television with 3840× 2160 as its resolution. And we’ve compared 4K and 1080P before, and you can check the difference and get a clue <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >why 4K is better than 1080P <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>The 4k technology allows the users to enjoy a very detailed screen of movies and videos which was not possible before. Though there are some 4K devices just as what we have rated before such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K monitor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> nowadays, 4k being relatively new, not all people have access to 4K devices and sometimes, and there are rather limited options to play 4K videos in a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4k video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. 4k being relatively new, there are not many devices that support 4k and rather limited options to play these videos in a 4k video player.</p>

<h3 id="4k-vs-1080p-1"><a href="#4k-vs-1080p-1" class="headerlink" title="4k vs 1080p"></a>4k vs 1080p</h3><p>It is understood that 4k is much better than 1080p but the real question is, can you see the difference between 4k and 1080p?</p>
<p><strong>Can people say for sure that’s 4k and that’s 1080p?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is <strong>Yes</strong>, that there is no significant difference in both resolutions but while using a 65 inches screen the difference becomes clear, and as you go up in the sizes it gets more prominent.</p>

                      alt="4kvs1080"
                ></p>
<p>Still, there are some pros and cons to both resolutions.</p>
<p>So do not wait…</p>
<p>Let us dive into the detail:</p>
<h3 id="What-is-a-4k-1"><a href="#What-is-a-4k-1" class="headerlink" title="What is a 4k?"></a>What is a 4k?</h3><p>As its name implies, it has almost 4000 pixels where it has <strong>3840 x 2160px</strong> or <strong>4096 x 2160</strong> horizontally and vertically and <strong>16:9</strong> is the Resolution. 4k presents clear and sharp graphics who loves to watch clear picture quality. It is commonly used in theaters and movies but it has also become common in residential use these days.</p>

                      alt="4k"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When it comes to resolution 4k is always a better choice as it has 4 times more data than 1080p which means it has good picture quality. Its pixels are much smaller and it provides detailed information about the picture.</li>
<li>It allows you to crop and scale without pixelating your video.</li>
<li>It can be downscaled. Downscaling means converting the video to a low resolution and still achieving better video quality.</li>
<li>If you are a professional video editor, you can charge more for 4k videos.<br><strong>Cons</strong></li>
<li>It occupies more space on your camera.</li>
<li>It is harder to record.</li>
<li>It takes up a big space in memory so it is harder to edit.</li>
<li>There is limited content for 4k videos.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What-is-a1080p-1"><a href="#What-is-a1080p-1" class="headerlink" title="What is a1080p?"></a>What is a1080p?</h3><p>As its name implies, it has almost 1000 pixels where it has <strong>1920 x 1080px</strong> horizontally and vertically and <strong>16:9</strong> is the Resolution. It is also known as Full HD or FHD.<br><img

                      alt="1080"
                ><br><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can edit and shoot your videos on an average laptop or camera even you can use your cell phone.</li>
<li>It is most preferable in shooting slow-motion videos.</li>
<li>It has better features in terms of FPS (frame rate per second).</li>
<li>It has a much better focus than 4k.</li>
<li>Most people use 1080p laptops and devices and 4k video would also be converted into 1080p.</li>
<li>1080p is more economical if you have a low budget. <strong>Cons</strong></li>
<li>Its pixels are not too small and the images are not sharper.</li>
<li>It gives a little low-quality video or image. The picture quality beats resolution.</li>
<li>You cannot scale and crop your video as it will ruin your video. You can see the result in the screenshot below.<br><img

<h3 id="4k-vs-1080p-2"><a href="#4k-vs-1080p-2" class="headerlink" title="4k vs 1080p"></a>4k vs 1080p</h3><p>It is understood that 4k is much better than 1080p but the real question is, can you see the difference between 4k and 1080p?</p>
<p><strong>Can people say for sure that’s 4k and that’s 1080p?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is <strong>Yes</strong>, that there is no significant difference in both resolutions but while using a 65 inches screen the difference becomes clear, and as you go up in the sizes it gets more prominent.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="4kvs1080"
                ></p>
<p>Still, there are some pros and cons to both resolutions.</p>
<p>So do not wait…</p>
<p>Let us dive into the detail:</p>
<h3 id="What-is-a-4k-2"><a href="#What-is-a-4k-2" class="headerlink" title="What is a 4k?"></a>What is a 4k?</h3><p>As its name implies, it has almost 4000 pixels where it has <strong>3840 x 2160px</strong> or <strong>4096 x 2160</strong> horizontally and vertically and <strong>16:9</strong> is the Resolution. 4k presents clear and sharp graphics who loves to watch clear picture quality. It is commonly used in theaters and movies but it has also become common in residential use these days.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="4k"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When it comes to resolution 4k is always a better choice as it has 4 times more data than 1080p which means it has good picture quality. Its pixels are much smaller and it provides detailed information about the picture.</li>
<li>It allows you to crop and scale without pixelating your video.</li>
<li>It can be downscaled. Downscaling means converting the video to a low resolution and still achieving better video quality.</li>
<li>If you are a professional video editor, you can charge more for 4k videos.<br><strong>Cons</strong></li>
<li>It occupies more space on your camera.</li>
<li>It is harder to record.</li>
<li>It takes up a big space in memory so it is harder to edit.</li>
<li>There is limited content for 4k videos.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What-is-a1080p-2"><a href="#What-is-a1080p-2" class="headerlink" title="What is a1080p?"></a>What is a1080p?</h3><p>As its name implies, it has almost 1000 pixels where it has <strong>1920 x 1080px</strong> horizontally and vertically and <strong>16:9</strong> is the Resolution. It is also known as Full HD or FHD.<br><img

                      alt="1080"
                ><br><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can edit and shoot your videos on an average laptop or camera even you can use your cell phone.</li>
<li>It is most preferable in shooting slow-motion videos.</li>
<li>It has better features in terms of FPS (frame rate per second).</li>
<li>It has a much better focus than 4k.</li>
<li>Most people use 1080p laptops and devices and 4k video would also be converted into 1080p.</li>
<li>1080p is more economical if you have a low budget. <strong>Cons</strong></li>
<li>Its pixels are not too small and the images are not sharper.</li>
<li>It gives a little low-quality video or image. The picture quality beats resolution.</li>
<li>You cannot scale and crop your video as it will ruin your video. You can see the result in the screenshot below.<br><img

                      alt="scale"
                ><br>In the picture above, you can clearly observe that the 4k image has sharp results around the edges of the image and written text. Hence it is clearer than 1080p.</li>

<p>We have been familiar with 1080p resolution for quite some years. However, HD has taken a new leap with ‘4k UHD’ offering higher than 1080p resolution. 4k UHD is mainly used in digital cinema with 4096x2160 as its pixel resolution or Ultra HD television with 3840× 2160 as its resolution. And we’ve compared 4K and 1080P before, and you can check the difference and get a clue <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >why 4K is better than 1080P <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

<h3 id="4k-vs-1080p-3"><a href="#4k-vs-1080p-3" class="headerlink" title="4k vs 1080p"></a>4k vs 1080p</h3><p>It is understood that 4k is much better than 1080p but the real question is, can you see the difference between 4k and 1080p?</p>
<p><strong>Can people say for sure that’s 4k and that’s 1080p?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is <strong>Yes</strong>, that there is no significant difference in both resolutions but while using a 65 inches screen the difference becomes clear, and as you go up in the sizes it gets more prominent.</p>

                      alt="4kvs1080"
                ></p>
<p>Still, there are some pros and cons to both resolutions.</p>
<p>So do not wait…</p>
<p>Let us dive into the detail:</p>
<h3 id="What-is-a-4k-3"><a href="#What-is-a-4k-3" class="headerlink" title="What is a 4k?"></a>What is a 4k?</h3><p>As its name implies, it has almost 4000 pixels where it has <strong>3840 x 2160px</strong> or <strong>4096 x 2160</strong> horizontally and vertically and <strong>16:9</strong> is the Resolution. 4k presents clear and sharp graphics who loves to watch clear picture quality. It is commonly used in theaters and movies but it has also become common in residential use these days.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="4k"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When it comes to resolution 4k is always a better choice as it has 4 times more data than 1080p which means it has good picture quality. Its pixels are much smaller and it provides detailed information about the picture.</li>
<li>It allows you to crop and scale without pixelating your video.</li>
<li>It can be downscaled. Downscaling means converting the video to a low resolution and still achieving better video quality.</li>
<li>If you are a professional video editor, you can charge more for 4k videos.<br><strong>Cons</strong></li>
<li>It occupies more space on your camera.</li>
<li>It is harder to record.</li>
<li>It takes up a big space in memory so it is harder to edit.</li>
<li>There is limited content for 4k videos.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What-is-a1080p-3"><a href="#What-is-a1080p-3" class="headerlink" title="What is a1080p?"></a>What is a1080p?</h3><p>As its name implies, it has almost 1000 pixels where it has <strong>1920 x 1080px</strong> horizontally and vertically and <strong>16:9</strong> is the Resolution. It is also known as Full HD or FHD.<br><img

                      alt="1080"
                ><br><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can edit and shoot your videos on an average laptop or camera even you can use your cell phone.</li>
<li>It is most preferable in shooting slow-motion videos.</li>
<li>It has better features in terms of FPS (frame rate per second).</li>
<li>It has a much better focus than 4k.</li>
<li>Most people use 1080p laptops and devices and 4k video would also be converted into 1080p.</li>
<li>1080p is more economical if you have a low budget. <strong>Cons</strong></li>
<li>Its pixels are not too small and the images are not sharper.</li>
<li>It gives a little low-quality video or image. The picture quality beats resolution.</li>
<li>You cannot scale and crop your video as it will ruin your video. You can see the result in the screenshot below.<br><img

                      alt="scale"
                ><br>In the picture above, you can clearly observe that the 4k image has sharp results around the edges of the image and written text. Hence it is clearer than 1080p.</li>

<p>We all know that <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Adobe Premiere Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best professional video editing software, while to run such a powerful video editing software, you may need a powerful windows PC or Mac as well. Though most modern computer systems can run Adobe Premiere out of the box, there are some steps to take, and potential decisions to make, before installing the software, or if you are building or buying a new computer to make sure you get the best experience possible with the software.</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel 6th or newer <strong>CPU</strong></li>
<li>Windows 10 (64-bit) 1703 or later&#x2F; MacOS V10.12 later</li>

<p>However, it is important to remember this is the minimum specification, and will not necessarily give a satisfactory user experience.

<li>Right click the <strong>This PC</strong> option in the sidebar and then select <strong>Properties</strong> from the context menu.</li>

<h2 id="How-to-Set-Up-Computer-for-Premiere"><a href="#How-to-Set-Up-Computer-for-Premiere" class="headerlink" title="How to Set Up Computer for Premiere"></a>How to Set Up Computer for Premiere</h2><h4 id="1-Processor"><a href="#1-Processor" class="headerlink" title="1. Processor"></a>1. Processor</h4><p>Whilst the software will run on a Core2Duo intel or Phenom II AMD processor, it is worth noting that <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cgdirector.com/best-cpu-for-rendering/" >rendering can be highly intensive work for the processor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the fastest possible processor within your budget will pay dividends in speed of editing. In general, even a Core I3, the cheapest of the current Intel range, will be significantly faster than older processors, but because Premiere happily uses multi cored processors to their full, if the budget can reach to a quad core or more processor then do so, Premiere is a piece of software that benefits from the computational power increase more than most.</p>
<h4 id="2-Memory"><a href="#2-Memory" class="headerlink" title="2. Memory"></a>2. Memory</h4><p>The next consideration is memory. The minimum specification suggests 4GB of RAM with 8GB recommended, for reliable and smooth running consider 8GB minimum, and go for as much as you can. For a computer that is used for other activities as well, multitasking can see even 24GB of Ram being fully utilized, especially if you are working on HD content. Speaking of content, this is the other aspect of memory to look at. Whilst you can use a storage drive that contains everything else on your computer to keep the media you are working on, for HD content especially, and for trouble free and the fastest possible operation it is advisable to reserve a single drive, preferably a 7200 RPM or faster one, exclusively for your media. Bandwidth and access times means Premiere will be significantly faster in operation with its media on a dedicated drive.</p>
<h4 id="3-Graphic"><a href="#3-Graphic" class="headerlink" title="3. Graphic"></a>3. Graphic</h4><p>The final aspect of specification to consider is graphics. Adobe Premiere uses a feature called the Mercury Playback Engine that allows much faster and smoother playback of video without rendering, it has two modes, software only and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32876/gpu-accelerated-computing" >GPU acceleration mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Using either CUDA or OpenCL). The GPU acceleration mode offers significant performance increases and is therefore highly desirable. However, not all GPU’s are compatible with the Mercury Playback Engine, the list of those that are is found on the previously linked specification page, so if a new computer is being built or purchased, or upgrades are being considered prior to install, it is highly desirable to utilize a compatible GPU where possible.</p>
<h4 id="5-Settings"><a href="#5-Settings" class="headerlink" title="5. Settings"></a>5. Settings</h4><p>Having covered the basic specifications of a computer that will enhance the operation of Premiere, it is now time to look at the computer settings and how this can affect Premiere’s performance and usability.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand is that video editing, especially HD video, is bandwidth intensive, in effect, it fills up the lanes between the CPU, RAM, GPU and Hard Drive during operation. Spreading the use of that bandwidth over several devices can see huge performance gains, so one of the best ways to optimize the computer for Premier is to adjust how the hard drives are used. How effective this can be depends on the computer you are using, so we will try to cover a few different possibilities here.</p>
<h4 id="6-Drive"><a href="#6-Drive" class="headerlink" title="6. Drive"></a>6. Drive</h4><p>If your computer contains a single drive, simply install Premiere and start using it, there are no options available here. If there are two drives, keep one for the operating system, programs and cache files. Use the second drive exclusively for video project files, exported projects and previews.</p>
<p>If the computer has three drives then keep one for the operating system and programs, the second one for the video project files, and use the third for previews, cache files and exported projects.</p>
<p>If you have access to even more drives, then split the cache from the previews, and ultimately have one drive each for previews, exports and cache. Spreading the files across as many drives as possible enhances performance by enabling the different read&#x2F;write operations to occur without interference from each other.</p>
<p>That is the theory, but how do you achieve this? This is done within Premiere itself, there are two parts, accessing where the media cache files are placed is done though the edit menu, following the path edit &gt; preferences &gt; media.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="adobe premiere requirements" title="adobe premiere requirements"
                ></p>
<p>Changing where the project files, previews and exports are stored is just as easy, and is accessed via the project menu by taking the path project &gt; project settings &gt; scratchdisks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h4 id="7-Sequence-Setting"><a href="#7-Sequence-Setting" class="headerlink" title="7. Sequence Setting"></a>7. Sequence Setting</h4><p>When working with Premiere it is important to have the correct settings for the type of media you are using and the nature of the final output. This is done within Premiere by a function known as a Sequence.</p>
<p>After creating a new project you are presented with the sequence dialogue box. You can have as many sequences in a single project as you like, but Premiere always assumes you require at least one and so needs the first one to be created to allow work on a project. Any media, both audio and video, placed into a sequence is automatically adapted to the settings of that sequence, so you will want to choose settings that match the original media as closely as possible. Each sequence in a project can have different settings if required, as this lessens the workload on the CPU and makes the process faster and smoother.</p>
<p>The sequence dialogue has three tabs, Sequence Presets, Settings and Tracks</p>
<p>The Preset Tab makes setting up a new sequence much simpler. Choosing a preset enables Premiere to choose the settings that best match the chosen video and audio format. There are a wide range of presets available to suit the most commonly used media types, they are organized based on camera formats. Within each group there are numerous settings and configurations to choose from based around frame sizes and interlacing. Whilst choosing the correct preset can be a little daunting to the uninitiated, ensuring the number of frames per second, the frame size and codec are correct is all that is required.</p>

<p>Once the preset is chosen you can move to the settings tab to adjust the preset manually. Some settings will not be adjustable in this tab due to the specific optimization required for the input media.</p>
<p>Because the presets do such a good job it is not really necessary to adjust anything in the settings tab, and unless you are trying to do something very specific.</p>
<p>While the standard presets are usually suitable, on occasion you may desire a custom setting. To do this, choose a sequence preset that is close to your media, and then make custom selections in the Settings tab. By selecting the Save Preset option on the Settings tab you can then create a custom setting with those parameters. Give the preset a suitable name in the Save Settings dialog and add any notes that are needed. The preset can be found in the Custom folder under Available Presets.</p>
<p>Those with the Apple Prores Codec on their computers can use this as the preview codec if required. By choosing Quicktime as the preview format in a custom editing mode, and lastly Apple Prores as the required codec.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If your computer failed to meet the requirement to run Premiere Pro, you may need to spend some money to buy a powerful computer or choose another professional video editing software similar to Premiere Pro, or choose a video editing software. If your computer isn’t powerful enough to run Premiere Pro, you will get awful experience at editing footage because of the long loading time and stuck playback.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Set-Up-Computer-for-Premiere-1"><a href="#How-to-Set-Up-Computer-for-Premiere-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Set Up Computer for Premiere"></a>How to Set Up Computer for Premiere</h2><h4 id="1-Processor-1"><a href="#1-Processor-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Processor"></a>1. Processor</h4><p>Whilst the software will run on a Core2Duo intel or Phenom II AMD processor, it is worth noting that <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cgdirector.com/best-cpu-for-rendering/" >rendering can be highly intensive work for the processor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the fastest possible processor within your budget will pay dividends in speed of editing. In general, even a Core I3, the cheapest of the current Intel range, will be significantly faster than older processors, but because Premiere happily uses multi cored processors to their full, if the budget can reach to a quad core or more processor then do so, Premiere is a piece of software that benefits from the computational power increase more than most.</p>
<h4 id="2-Memory-1"><a href="#2-Memory-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Memory"></a>2. Memory</h4><p>The next consideration is memory. The minimum specification suggests 4GB of RAM with 8GB recommended, for reliable and smooth running consider 8GB minimum, and go for as much as you can. For a computer that is used for other activities as well, multitasking can see even 24GB of Ram being fully utilized, especially if you are working on HD content. Speaking of content, this is the other aspect of memory to look at. Whilst you can use a storage drive that contains everything else on your computer to keep the media you are working on, for HD content especially, and for trouble free and the fastest possible operation it is advisable to reserve a single drive, preferably a 7200 RPM or faster one, exclusively for your media. Bandwidth and access times means Premiere will be significantly faster in operation with its media on a dedicated drive.</p>
<h4 id="3-Graphic-1"><a href="#3-Graphic-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Graphic"></a>3. Graphic</h4><p>The final aspect of specification to consider is graphics. Adobe Premiere uses a feature called the Mercury Playback Engine that allows much faster and smoother playback of video without rendering, it has two modes, software only and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32876/gpu-accelerated-computing" >GPU acceleration mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Using either CUDA or OpenCL). The GPU acceleration mode offers significant performance increases and is therefore highly desirable. However, not all GPU’s are compatible with the Mercury Playback Engine, the list of those that are is found on the previously linked specification page, so if a new computer is being built or purchased, or upgrades are being considered prior to install, it is highly desirable to utilize a compatible GPU where possible.</p>
<h4 id="5-Settings-1"><a href="#5-Settings-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Settings"></a>5. Settings</h4><p>Having covered the basic specifications of a computer that will enhance the operation of Premiere, it is now time to look at the computer settings and how this can affect Premiere’s performance and usability.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand is that video editing, especially HD video, is bandwidth intensive, in effect, it fills up the lanes between the CPU, RAM, GPU and Hard Drive during operation. Spreading the use of that bandwidth over several devices can see huge performance gains, so one of the best ways to optimize the computer for Premier is to adjust how the hard drives are used. How effective this can be depends on the computer you are using, so we will try to cover a few different possibilities here.</p>
<h4 id="6-Drive-1"><a href="#6-Drive-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Drive"></a>6. Drive</h4><p>If your computer contains a single drive, simply install Premiere and start using it, there are no options available here. If there are two drives, keep one for the operating system, programs and cache files. Use the second drive exclusively for video project files, exported projects and previews.</p>
<p>If the computer has three drives then keep one for the operating system and programs, the second one for the video project files, and use the third for previews, cache files and exported projects.</p>
<p>If you have access to even more drives, then split the cache from the previews, and ultimately have one drive each for previews, exports and cache. Spreading the files across as many drives as possible enhances performance by enabling the different read&#x2F;write operations to occur without interference from each other.</p>
<p>That is the theory, but how do you achieve this? This is done within Premiere itself, there are two parts, accessing where the media cache files are placed is done though the edit menu, following the path edit &gt; preferences &gt; media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="adobe premiere requirements" title="adobe premiere requirements"
                ></p>
<p>Changing where the project files, previews and exports are stored is just as easy, and is accessed via the project menu by taking the path project &gt; project settings &gt; scratchdisks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adobe premiere requirements" title="adobe premiere requirements"
                ></p>
<h4 id="7-Sequence-Setting-1"><a href="#7-Sequence-Setting-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Sequence Setting"></a>7. Sequence Setting</h4><p>When working with Premiere it is important to have the correct settings for the type of media you are using and the nature of the final output. This is done within Premiere by a function known as a Sequence.</p>
<p>After creating a new project you are presented with the sequence dialogue box. You can have as many sequences in a single project as you like, but Premiere always assumes you require at least one and so needs the first one to be created to allow work on a project. Any media, both audio and video, placed into a sequence is automatically adapted to the settings of that sequence, so you will want to choose settings that match the original media as closely as possible. Each sequence in a project can have different settings if required, as this lessens the workload on the CPU and makes the process faster and smoother.</p>
<p>The sequence dialogue has three tabs, Sequence Presets, Settings and Tracks</p>
<p>The Preset Tab makes setting up a new sequence much simpler. Choosing a preset enables Premiere to choose the settings that best match the chosen video and audio format. There are a wide range of presets available to suit the most commonly used media types, they are organized based on camera formats. Within each group there are numerous settings and configurations to choose from based around frame sizes and interlacing. Whilst choosing the correct preset can be a little daunting to the uninitiated, ensuring the number of frames per second, the frame size and codec are correct is all that is required.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

To do this, choose a sequence preset that is close to your media, and then make custom selections in the Settings tab. By selecting the Save Preset option on the Settings tab you can then create a custom setting with those parameters. Give the preset a suitable name in the Save Settings dialog and add any notes that are needed. The preset can be found in the Custom folder under Available Presets.</p>
<p>Those with the Apple Prores Codec on their computers can use this as the preview codec if required. By choosing Quicktime as the preview format in a custom editing mode, and lastly Apple Prores as the required codec.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If your computer failed to meet the requirement to run Premiere Pro, you may need to spend some money to buy a powerful computer or choose another professional video editing software similar to Premiere Pro, or choose a video editing software. If your computer isn’t powerful enough to run Premiere Pro, you will get awful experience at editing footage because of the long loading time and stuck playback.</p>

<p>We all know that <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Adobe Premiere Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best professional video editing software, while to run such a powerful video editing software, you may need a powerful windows PC or Mac as well. Though most modern computer systems can run Adobe Premiere out of the box, there are some steps to take, and potential decisions to make, before installing the software, or if you are building or buying a new computer to make sure you get the best experience possible with the software.</p>

<h2 id="Minimum-system-requirement-to-run-Premiere-Pro-on-Windows-and-Mac-in-2019-3"><a href="#Minimum-system-requirement-to-run-Premiere-Pro-on-Windows-and-Mac-in-2019-3" class="headerlink" title="Minimum system requirement to run Premiere Pro on Windows and Mac in 2019"></a>Minimum system requirement to run Premiere Pro on Windows and Mac in 2019</h2><p>Your computer should at least to meet <strong>the minimum specification</strong> below to run Premiere Pro, and if you need to edit some VR videos, your computer configuration should be higher according to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html" >the minimum specifications list on their website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel 6th or newer <strong>CPU</strong></li>
<li>Windows 10 (64-bit) 1703 or later&#x2F; MacOS V10.12 later</li>
<li><strong>16GB RAM</strong>; 4GB GPU VRAM</li>
<li>Fast internal SSD</li>
<li>1920*1080 <strong>Display resolution</strong></li>
<li>32-bit <strong>video card</strong></li>
<li><strong>Internet connection</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>However, it is important to remember this is the minimum specification, and will not necessarily give a satisfactory user experience. The recommended specifications are far more likely to provide the kind of performance expected of the software and those would be the ones to use as a guide for the minimum spec for a new computer or any upgrades being planned prior to installation.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Set-Up-Computer-for-Premiere-3"><a href="#How-to-Set-Up-Computer-for-Premiere-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Set Up Computer for Premiere"></a>How to Set Up Computer for Premiere</h2><h4 id="1-Processor-3"><a href="#1-Processor-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Processor"></a>1. Processor</h4><p>Whilst the software will run on a Core2Duo intel or Phenom II AMD processor, it is worth noting that <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cgdirector.com/best-cpu-for-rendering/" >rendering can be highly intensive work for the processor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the fastest possible processor within your budget will pay dividends in speed of editing. In general, even a Core I3, the cheapest of the current Intel range, will be significantly faster than older processors, but because Premiere happily uses multi cored processors to their full, if the budget can reach to a quad core or more processor then do so, Premiere is a piece of software that benefits from the computational power increase more than most.</p>
<h4 id="2-Memory-3"><a href="#2-Memory-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Memory"></a>2. Memory</h4><p>The next consideration is memory. The minimum specification suggests 4GB of RAM with 8GB recommended, for reliable and smooth running consider 8GB minimum, and go for as much as you can. For a computer that is used for other activities as well, multitasking can see even 24GB of Ram being fully utilized, especially if you are working on HD content. Speaking of content, this is the other aspect of memory to look at. Whilst you can use a storage drive that contains everything else on your computer to keep the media you are working on, for HD content especially, and for trouble free and the fastest possible operation it is advisable to reserve a single drive, preferably a 7200 RPM or faster one, exclusively for your media. Bandwidth and access times means Premiere will be significantly faster in operation with its media on a dedicated drive.</p>
<h4 id="3-Graphic-3"><a href="#3-Graphic-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Graphic"></a>3. Graphic</h4><p>The final aspect of specification to consider is graphics. Adobe Premiere uses a feature called the Mercury Playback Engine that allows much faster and smoother playback of video without rendering, it has two modes, software only and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32876/gpu-accelerated-computing" >GPU acceleration mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Using either CUDA or OpenCL). The GPU acceleration mode offers significant performance increases and is therefore highly desirable. However, not all GPU’s are compatible with the Mercury Playback Engine, the list of those that are is found on the previously linked specification page, so if a new computer is being built or purchased, or upgrades are being considered prior to install, it is highly desirable to utilize a compatible GPU where possible.</p>
<h4 id="5-Settings-3"><a href="#5-Settings-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Settings"></a>5. Settings</h4><p>Having covered the basic specifications of a computer that will enhance the operation of Premiere, it is now time to look at the computer settings and how this can affect Premiere’s performance and usability.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand is that video editing, especially HD video, is bandwidth intensive, in effect, it fills up the lanes between the CPU, RAM, GPU and Hard Drive during operation. Spreading the use of that bandwidth over several devices can see huge performance gains, so one of the best ways to optimize the computer for Premier is to adjust how the hard drives are used. How effective this can be depends on the computer you are using, so we will try to cover a few different possibilities here.</p>
<h4 id="6-Drive-3"><a href="#6-Drive-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Drive"></a>6. Drive</h4><p>If your computer contains a single drive, simply install Premiere and start using it, there are no options available here. If there are two drives, keep one for the operating system, programs and cache files. Use the second drive exclusively for video project files, exported projects and previews.</p>
<p>If the computer has three drives then keep one for the operating system and programs, the second one for the video project files, and use the third for previews, cache files and exported projects.</p>
<p>If you have access to even more drives, then split the cache from the previews, and ultimately have one drive each for previews, exports and cache. Spreading the files across as many drives as possible enhances performance by enabling the different read&#x2F;write operations to occur without interference from each other.</p>
<p>That is the theory, but how do you achieve this? This is done within Premiere itself, there are two parts, accessing where the media cache files are placed is done though the edit menu, following the path edit &gt; preferences &gt; media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-premiere-1.png"
                      alt="adobe premiere requirements" title="adobe premiere requirements"
                ></p>
<p>Changing where the project files, previews and exports are stored is just as easy, and is accessed via the project menu by taking the path project &gt; project settings &gt; scratchdisks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-premiere-2.png"
                      alt="adobe premiere requirements" title="adobe premiere requirements"
                ></p>
<h4 id="7-Sequence-Setting-3"><a href="#7-Sequence-Setting-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Sequence Setting"></a>7. Sequence Setting</h4><p>When working with Premiere it is important to have the correct settings for the type of media you are using and the nature of the final output. This is done within Premiere by a function known as a Sequence.</p>
<p>After creating a new project you are presented with the sequence dialogue box. You can have as many sequences in a single project as you like, but Premiere always assumes you require at least one and so needs the first one to be created to allow work on a project. Any media, both audio and video, placed into a sequence is automatically adapted to the settings of that sequence, so you will want to choose settings that match the original media as closely as possible. Each sequence in a project can have different settings if required, as this lessens the workload on the CPU and makes the process faster and smoother.</p>
<p>The sequence dialogue has three tabs, Sequence Presets, Settings and Tracks</p>
<p>The Preset Tab makes setting up a new sequence much simpler. Choosing a preset enables Premiere to choose the settings that best match the chosen video and audio format. There are a wide range of presets available to suit the most commonly used media types, they are organized based on camera formats. Within each group there are numerous settings and configurations to choose from based around frame sizes and interlacing. Whilst choosing the correct preset can be a little daunting to the uninitiated, ensuring the number of frames per second, the frame size and codec are correct is all that is required.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-premiere-3.png"
                      alt="adobe premiere requirements" title="adobe premiere requirements"
                ></p>
<p>Once the preset is chosen you can move to the settings tab to adjust the preset manually. Some settings will not be adjustable in this tab due to the specific optimization required for the input media.</p>
<p>Because the presets do such a good job it is not really necessary to adjust anything in the settings tab, and unless you are trying to do something very specific.</p>
<p>While the standard presets are usually suitable, on occasion you may desire a custom setting. To do this, choose a sequence preset that is close to your media, and then make custom selections in the Settings tab. By selecting the Save Preset option on the Settings tab you can then create a custom setting with those parameters. Give the preset a suitable name in the Save Settings dialog and add any notes that are needed. The preset can be found in the Custom folder under Available Presets.</p>
<p>Those with the Apple Prores Codec on their computers can use this as the preview codec if required. By choosing Quicktime as the preview format in a custom editing mode, and lastly Apple Prores as the required codec.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If your computer failed to meet the requirement to run Premiere Pro, you may need to spend some money to buy a powerful computer or choose another professional video editing software similar to Premiere Pro, or choose a video editing software. If your computer isn’t powerful enough to run Premiere Pro, you will get awful experience at editing footage because of the long loading time and stuck playback.</p>
