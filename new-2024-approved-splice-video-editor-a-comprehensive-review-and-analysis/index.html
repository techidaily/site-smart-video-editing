<p>Video creation is on the increase, especially with smartphones and easy-to-reach tablets. Simply take a video to share with your loved ones.

<p>Leading a healthy lifestyle is much easier if you have the assistance of the world’s leading instructors.

Even so, the app’s interface is somewhat outdated and the app crashes easily during workouts, which makes using Peloton frequently a bit difficult.</p>

<p>Managing and organizing vast amounts of handwritten notes is a futile effort as sorting out hundreds of tiny pieces of paper is often impossible.

Once you’ve created and organized your board you can share it with your colleagues or export it to Excel, PowerPoint or Trello.

<p>It is hard to believe that in 2024 Google Play had just fifty apps since it currently offers 2.8 million applications that can be used for anything from photo and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to learning a new language.</p>
<p>This year Google Play had a difficult task of selecting the best app of 2024, as there are so many apps across different categories that are worthy of this award. On December 3rd Google Play announced its choice and also presented the best Android apps of 2024 that were selected by users. So without further ado let’s take a look at the best and most popular Android apps of 2024</p>
<h2 id="The-Best-App-of-2024-Selected-by-Google-Play-Ablo-2"><a href="#The-Best-App-of-2024-Selected-by-Google-Play-Ablo-2" class="headerlink" title="The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: Ablo"></a>The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.ablo&hl=en" >Ablo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>Language barriers can prevent us from exploring the world and experiencing different cultures. So, it is no wonder that an app that enables its users to talk to people from around the globe in their mother tongue was chosen as the best app of 2024 by Google Play.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Ablo translates all chat messages in real-time which enables you to talk with all likeminded people you meet even if you don’t speak the same language.</p>
<p>The app also translates video calls live and allows you to have meaningful conversations with friends that come from different parts of the world. If you are traveling often and looking for an easy way to encounter the local culture or you just want to communicate with people whose language you don’t understand, then you should install Ablo and start making friends around the world.</p>

<p>Leading a healthy lifestyle is much easier if you have the assistance of the world’s leading instructors. If you already own a Peloton bike or tread, then you can enjoy all the benefits of the Peloton app for free. Yoga, cardio or indoor cycling are just a few among numerous types of classes you can attend through this Android app. In addition, you can also broadcast your workouts through the Peloton’s Chromecast support and share your daily workout routines with thousands of followers. Even so, the app’s interface is somewhat outdated and the app crashes easily during workouts, which makes using Peloton frequently a bit difficult.</p>

<p>It is hard to believe that in 2024 Google Play had just fifty apps since it currently offers 2.8 million applications that can be used for anything from photo and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to learning a new language.</p>
<p>This year Google Play had a difficult task of selecting the best app of 2024, as there are so many apps across different categories that are worthy of this award. On December 3rd Google Play announced its choice and also presented the best Android apps of 2024 that were selected by users. So without further ado let’s take a look at the best and most popular Android apps of 2024</p>
<h2 id="The-Best-App-of-2024-Selected-by-Google-Play-Ablo-3"><a href="#The-Best-App-of-2024-Selected-by-Google-Play-Ablo-3" class="headerlink" title="The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: Ablo"></a>The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.ablo&hl=en" >Ablo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>Language barriers can prevent us from exploring the world and experiencing different cultures. So, it is no wonder that an app that enables its users to talk to people from around the globe in their mother tongue was chosen as the best app of 2024 by Google Play.</p>

                      alt=" 
Ablo: Make new friends from all over the world "
                ></p>
<p>Ablo translates all chat messages in real-time which enables you to talk with all likeminded people you meet even if you don’t speak the same language.</p>
<p>The app also translates video calls live and allows you to have meaningful conversations with friends that come from different parts of the world. If you are traveling often and looking for an easy way to encounter the local culture or you just want to communicate with people whose language you don’t understand, then you should install Ablo and start making friends around the world.</p>

Over the course of 2024 apps from a broad range of categories have sparked the interest of thousands of Android users. Here are some of the most popular apps of 2024 that can help you improve your productivity or make better fashion choices.</p>
<h3 id="1-Peloton-3"><a href="#1-Peloton-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

                      alt="InShot Video Editor - Glitch Video Effects "
                ></p>
<p>Leading a healthy lifestyle is much easier if you have the assistance of the world’s leading instructors. If you already own a Peloton bike or tread, then you can enjoy all the benefits of the Peloton app for free. Yoga, cardio or indoor cycling are just a few among numerous types of classes you can attend through this Android app. In addition, you can also broadcast your workouts through the Peloton’s Chromecast support and share your daily workout routines with thousands of followers. Even so, the app’s interface is somewhat outdated and the app crashes easily during workouts, which makes using Peloton frequently a bit difficult.</p>

<p>If you would like to keep track of the latest fashion trends and discover places where you can buy clothes and accessories worn by your favorite influencers, then you should install the 21 Buttons app on your phone. This social network for fashion enthusiasts can help you choose new outfits and save them in your public or private closets. What’s more, you can share the fashion choices with your followers and link to the stores where particular items can be purchased. This app also enables you to search for up and coming brands, since it is hard to find a fashion brand that isn’t featured on 21 Buttons.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Managing and organizing vast amounts of handwritten notes is a futile effort as sorting out hundreds of tiny pieces of paper is often impossible. Installing the Post-it app that captures handwritten notes and allows you to organize them in any way you want can help you perform your daily tasks more efficiently. Once you’ve created and organized your board you can share it with your colleagues or export it to Excel, PowerPoint or Trello. Post-it can capture more than 200 notes at the same time using your phone’s camera and use the Handwriting Recognition AI to transcribe them. Each not you create with this app can be easily edited or deleted.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Learning a new language should be a fun process that is not going to take too much of your time. Scripts by Drops limits the total amount of time you can spend practicing a new language to just five minutes a day. Even though this may seem far from enough to master Chinese Hanzi or to learn Russian Cyrillic, this app will deliver the results you’re looking for as long as you keep using it every single day. Scripts by Drops employs visual learning techniques that help the app’s users connect letters and characters to their pronunciations. If you opt for one of the available subscription models you will have an unlimited amount of learning time at your disposal.</p>

<p>In historic terms, cinema is still a relatively new art, and yet the amount of footage that has been filmed since the Lumière brothers released their first film is staggering. Capturing unique materials that were never seen by the world before has become the question of prestige among the filmmakers. Nonetheless, certain genres of film are almost entirely dependent on the public domain footage. Documentaries about historic events, space or any other topic that is impossible to stage rely on the videos that entered the public domain for one reason or the other. That’s why in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best websites that let you download public domain videos.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Public-Domain-Video"><a href="#What-is-Public-Domain-Video" class="headerlink" title="What is Public Domain Video?"></a>What is Public Domain Video?</h2><p>Any video that is not subject to copyright can be considered a public domain video. This means that anyone can use this footage for free without having to ask for permission to do so. Videos can enter the public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the footage was produced by a government because governments are obligated by the law to offer the footage to the public domain.</li>
<li>In case the author of the footage has forfeited his or her copyrights and dedicated the footage to the public domain</li>
<li>A film or any other work of art becomes public domain 70 years after the death of the copyright holder. The expiration date of the copyrights is not the same in all the countries around the world, which is why you must make sure that the video you want to use is, in fact, a public domain video.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you should avoid using the footage that contains art or music that can be described as third-party intellectual property because you may unintentionally infringe copyrights.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Online-Websites-Where-You-Can-Download-Public-Domain-Videos"><a href="#Best-Online-Websites-Where-You-Can-Download-Public-Domain-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Best Online Websites Where You Can Download Public Domain Videos"></a>Best Online Websites Where You Can Download Public Domain Videos</h2><p><strong>Finding free public domain footage or public movies</strong> on the Internet has never been too difficult, as you can watch thousands of public domain movies on YouTube, but you cannot download them. Over the course of the last couple of decades, the websites where you can <strong>download public domain footage</strong> have grown in number, which makes it somewhat easier to find the video clips you can use in your projects for free. Here are some of the best online destinations where you can <strong>download public domain videos</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="1-Prelinger-Archive"><a href="#1-Prelinger-Archive" class="headerlink" title="1.

                      alt="Public Domain Video Download "
                ></p>
<p>With more than 17,000 items in the collection, the Prelinger Archive is probably one of the largest public domain video libraries on the Internet. The archive was founded in 1983 by Rick Prelinger, but by 2002 it became a part of the Library of Congress Motion Picture Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Divison’s collection. You can <strong>download public domain video clips</strong> created by educational institutions, advertising companies, trade associations or corporations from this impressive collection. There are different download options available for each file, so you can choose the size of a file and the method you’re going to use to download a file to your computer.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This is an excellent resource for researchers looking for essays, books, audio recordings, images or old films. The movies are divided into different categories such as Animals&amp;Beasts, Politics, War or Sports which makes locating and <strong>downloading public domain videos</strong> faster and easier. The Public Domain Review offers footage that is available within different public domain licenses, so you must make sure that the film you want to download can be used for the purpose you have in mind. The vast majority of the films in this archive are from the last decade of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. That’s why The Public Domain Review’s selection of films can only be useful if you are researching a topic from that era.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The National Screening Room is a project created by the Library of Congress National Audio-Visual Conservation Center with the aim of making the videos from their collection available to the viewers around the world. The vast majority of the videos in the collection were filmed during the 20th century, but there are only a few videos available that are produced outside of the United States. The National Screening Room can be a valuable asset if you are looking for videos you can use for educational or research videos that cover topics that range from the development of the arms industry to the daily life of great American inventors.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Industry professionals don’t need an introduction to the Pond5 platform, because it is probably the largest online marketplace for royalty-free media at the moment. Their Public Domain Project contains a thousand public videos that can be downloaded for free, but the duration of these videos is limited to just two minutes To make things worse, most of these public domain videos don’t have audio, so you can only use them if you already have a soundtrack for the video you’re making. The platform offers powerful search tools that enable you to look for videos based on different parameters. You can download public domain videos in HD resolution, but you must create an account on Pond5 before you can save them to your computer.</p>
<h4 id="5-Pexels"><a href="#5-Pexels" class="headerlink" title="5. Pexels"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/public%20domain/" >Pexels <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

<p><strong>Free public domain stock footage</strong> can be used on different types of projects, and it is usually a great choice if you’re looking for some extra shots that will make a scene in your video more cinematic. Pexels offers an impressive collection of free public domain stock videos, so you just have to insert a search term and pick a video clip that best fits your needs. The duration of the free videos you can find on Pexels rarely exceeds thirty seconds, which makes it difficult to make an entire video exclusively from free public domain stock footage. Hence it is better to use Pexels as a complementary source of shots in case you can’t go back to the filming location.</p>
<h4 id="6-Vidsplay"><a href="#6-Vidsplay" class="headerlink" title="6. Vidsplay"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vidsplay.com/" >Vidsplay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>All video clips you can find on this platform are free, so you just have to select one of the categories and start browsing through the available public domain stock footage. The only condition to use the stock footage on private or commercial projects for free is to credit the Vidsplay platform in the end credits, on the website or in the description of the videos you upload to your social media channels. All stock videos on Vidsplay are available in HD or 4K resolution, and you simply have to click on the Download button below a particular video to save it.</p>

Within the Moving Image Archive, you can find different collections that contain full feature movies, art videos, animations, cartoons or television footage. The public domain videos hosted on The Moving Image Archive cover a broad range of topics, but some of them can be in poor resolution. The Moving Image Archive can be an excellent source of footage for anyone who wants to download <strong>public domain video clips</strong> and use them in their commercial or non-commercial projects.</p>
<h4 id="8-PublicDomainFootage"><a href="#8-PublicDomainFootage" class="headerlink" title="8.

All content on the platform is divided into Archival Footage and Historic Newsreels sections that contain categories like Atomic Age, Civil Rights or Pop Culture. You can also use PublicDomainFootage to research a particular topic and request content that is not uploaded to the website. You can <strong>download a public domain video</strong> after you pay a one time fee that enables you to use that video as many times as you want. The platform’s YouTube channel provides an easy way of searching for public domain videos you are going to use in your next documentary film.</p>
<h4 id="9-NASA’s-Video-Gallery"><a href="#9-NASA’s-Video-Gallery" class="headerlink" title="9. NASA’s Video Gallery"></a>9. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.nasa.gov/" >NASA’s Video Gallery <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Space exploration is undoubtedly one of the hottest topics of our era, so if you are looking for some space public domain videos NASA’s website is the best place to start. Like all other government institutions, NASA is obligated by the law to offer all images and videos to the public domain. This means that all content you download from their website is free to use. Simply insert the search term and browse the results until you find the video clip you want to save to your computer. However, most public domain videos you can download from NASA’s website last only a couple of minutes.</p>
<h4 id="10-Motion-Elements"><a href="#10-Motion-Elements" class="headerlink" title="10.

Categories like Cityscape, Animals or Water contain hundreds of stock videos, so you just have to open one of the available categories and locate the video clip you want to download. However, you must first create an account on Motion Elements before you can save video files to your computer. In addition, the platform doesn’t allow you to make more than five downloads per week and you must invite your friends to join the platform if you want to increase the weekly number of downloads. Even so, Motion Elements is a great source of stock footage you can use without any restrictions.</p>
<h2 id="Is-It-Okay-to-Use-Public-Domain-Videos-for-Commercial-Purposes"><a href="#Is-It-Okay-to-Use-Public-Domain-Videos-for-Commercial-Purposes" class="headerlink" title="Is It Okay to Use Public Domain Videos for Commercial Purposes?"></a>Is It Okay to Use Public Domain Videos for Commercial Purposes?</h2><p>All public domain videos can be used for both commercial and non-commercial projects, but you must approach using public domain videos for commercial purposes with caution. Crediting the author or providing the source from which you acquired the footage will reduce the likelihood of legal complications. The public domain videos that feature famous actors or third party intellectual property can also be a subject of legal disputes, which is why it is better to avoid using them on commercial projects.</p>
<h2 id="What-Should-You-Do-If-You-Can’t-Find-Public-Domain-Footage-for-Your-Project"><a href="#What-Should-You-Do-If-You-Can’t-Find-Public-Domain-Footage-for-Your-Project" class="headerlink" title="What Should You Do If You Can’t Find Public Domain Footage for Your Project?"></a>What Should You Do If You Can’t Find Public Domain Footage for Your Project?</h2><p>Opting for videos that are protected by the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/" >Creative Commons licenses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is probably the safest option if you’re struggling to find the public domain footage you’d like to use in your project. Respecting the terms of the license under which a video is protected is of utmost importance, since failing to properly credit the author of the video, for instance, can have legal consequences. There are several different types of Creative Commons licenses and you must find out which one covers the video you’d like to use, before publishing your video. You can find more information about Creative Commons licenses at the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/" >FAQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Public domain videos cover very different topics, which means that the nature of your project determines the source from which you’ll acquire the footage. If you are researching the early days of cinema, then you’ll have no trouble downloading the public domain videos, but if the topic you’re exploring is more contemporary, finding the content you can use without any restrictions can prove to be troublesome.

<p>In historic terms, cinema is still a relatively new art, and yet the amount of footage that has been filmed since the Lumière brothers released their first film is staggering. Capturing unique materials that were never seen by the world before has become the question of prestige among the filmmakers. Nonetheless, certain genres of film are almost entirely dependent on the public domain footage. Documentaries about historic events, space or any other topic that is impossible to stage rely on the videos that entered the public domain for one reason or the other. That’s why in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best websites that let you download public domain videos.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Public-Domain-Video-2"><a href="#What-is-Public-Domain-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="What is Public Domain Video?"></a>What is Public Domain Video?</h2><p>Any video that is not subject to copyright can be considered a public domain video. This means that anyone can use this footage for free without having to ask for permission to do so. Videos can enter the public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the footage was produced by a government because governments are obligated by the law to offer the footage to the public domain.</li>
<li>In case the author of the footage has forfeited his or her copyrights and dedicated the footage to the public domain</li>
<li>A film or any other work of art becomes public domain 70 years after the death of the copyright holder. The expiration date of the copyrights is not the same in all the countries around the world, which is why you must make sure that the video you want to use is, in fact, a public domain video.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you should avoid using the footage that contains art or music that can be described as third-party intellectual property because you may unintentionally infringe copyrights.</p>

<p>In historic terms, cinema is still a relatively new art, and yet the amount of footage that has been filmed since the Lumière brothers released their first film is staggering. Capturing unique materials that were never seen by the world before has become the question of prestige among the filmmakers. Nonetheless, certain genres of film are almost entirely dependent on the public domain footage. Documentaries about historic events, space or any other topic that is impossible to stage rely on the videos that entered the public domain for one reason or the other. That’s why in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best websites that let you download public domain videos.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Public-Domain-Video-3"><a href="#What-is-Public-Domain-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="What is Public Domain Video?"></a>What is Public Domain Video?</h2><p>Any video that is not subject to copyright can be considered a public domain video. This means that anyone can use this footage for free without having to ask for permission to do so. Videos can enter the public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the footage was produced by a government because governments are obligated by the law to offer the footage to the public domain.</li>
<li>In case the author of the footage has forfeited his or her copyrights and dedicated the footage to the public domain</li>
<li>A film or any other work of art becomes public domain 70 years after the death of the copyright holder. The expiration date of the copyrights is not the same in all the countries around the world, which is why you must make sure that the video you want to use is, in fact, a public domain video.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you should avoid using the footage that contains art or music that can be described as third-party intellectual property because you may unintentionally infringe copyrights.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Online-Websites-Where-You-Can-Download-Public-Domain-Videos-3"><a href="#Best-Online-Websites-Where-You-Can-Download-Public-Domain-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Online Websites Where You Can Download Public Domain Videos"></a>Best Online Websites Where You Can Download Public Domain Videos</h2><p><strong>Finding free public domain footage or public movies</strong> on the Internet has never been too difficult, as you can watch thousands of public domain movies on YouTube, but you cannot download them. Over the course of the last couple of decades, the websites where you can <strong>download public domain footage</strong> have grown in number, which makes it somewhat easier to find the video clips you can use in your projects for free. Here are some of the best online destinations where you can <strong>download public domain videos</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="1-Prelinger-Archive-3"><a href="#1-Prelinger-Archive-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Prelinger Archive"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://archive.org/details/prelinger" >Prelinger Archive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="Public Domain Video Download "
                ></p>
<p>With more than 17,000 items in the collection, the Prelinger Archive is probably one of the largest public domain video libraries on the Internet. The archive was founded in 1983 by Rick Prelinger, but by 2002 it became a part of the Library of Congress Motion Picture Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Divison’s collection. You can <strong>download public domain video clips</strong> created by educational institutions, advertising companies, trade associations or corporations from this impressive collection. There are different download options available for each file, so you can choose the size of a file and the method you’re going to use to download a file to your computer.</p>
<h4 id="2-The-Public-Domain-Review-3"><a href="#2-The-Public-Domain-Review-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

                ></p>
<p>This is an excellent resource for researchers looking for essays, books, audio recordings, images or old films. The movies are divided into different categories such as Animals&amp;Beasts, Politics, War or Sports which makes locating and <strong>downloading public domain videos</strong> faster and easier. The Public Domain Review offers footage that is available within different public domain licenses, so you must make sure that the film you want to download can be used for the purpose you have in mind. The vast majority of the films in this archive are from the last decade of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. That’s why The Public Domain Review’s selection of films can only be useful if you are researching a topic from that era.</p>
<h4 id="3-The-National-Screening-Room-3"><a href="#3-The-National-Screening-Room-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

                      alt="National Screening Room Public Domain Video Collection "
                ></p>
<p>The National Screening Room is a project created by the Library of Congress National Audio-Visual Conservation Center with the aim of making the videos from their collection available to the viewers around the world. The vast majority of the videos in the collection were filmed during the 20th century, but there are only a few videos available that are produced outside of the United States. The National Screening Room can be a valuable asset if you are looking for videos you can use for educational or research videos that cover topics that range from the development of the arms industry to the daily life of great American inventors.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Industry professionals don’t need an introduction to the Pond5 platform, because it is probably the largest online marketplace for royalty-free media at the moment. Their Public Domain Project contains a thousand public videos that can be downloaded for free, but the duration of these videos is limited to just two minutes To make things worse, most of these public domain videos don’t have audio, so you can only use them if you already have a soundtrack for the video you’re making. The platform offers powerful search tools that enable you to look for videos based on different parameters. You can download public domain videos in HD resolution, but you must create an account on Pond5 before you can save them to your computer.</p>
<h4 id="5-Pexels-3"><a href="#5-Pexels-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Pexels"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/public%20domain/" >Pexels <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

<p><strong>Free public domain stock footage</strong> can be used on different types of projects, and it is usually a great choice if you’re looking for some extra shots that will make a scene in your video more cinematic. Pexels offers an impressive collection of free public domain stock videos, so you just have to insert a search term and pick a video clip that best fits your needs. The duration of the free videos you can find on Pexels rarely exceeds thirty seconds, which makes it difficult to make an entire video exclusively from free public domain stock footage. Hence it is better to use Pexels as a complementary source of shots in case you can’t go back to the filming location.</p>
<h4 id="6-Vidsplay-3"><a href="#6-Vidsplay-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Vidsplay"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vidsplay.com/" >Vidsplay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>All video clips you can find on this platform are free, so you just have to select one of the categories and start browsing through the available public domain stock footage. The only condition to use the stock footage on private or commercial projects for free is to credit the Vidsplay platform in the end credits, on the website or in the description of the videos you upload to your social media channels. All stock videos on Vidsplay are available in HD or 4K resolution, and you simply have to click on the Download button below a particular video to save it.</p>

<h3 id="1-OpenShot"><a href="#1-OpenShot" class="headerlink" title="1. OpenShot"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.openshot.org/" >OpenShot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>We are confident that you will not find a more user-friendly video editor than this one. OpenShot is most likely the best choice when you’re new to video production. It is simple to use, but it also has several interesting features.</p>
<p>This editor comes with a plethora of titles and transitions and compatibility for the majority of video and picture formats. You also receive an excellent export option that allows you to save files in various formats. As already mentioned, the application is designed to meet the needs of beginning learners; yet, advanced users will not be dissatisfied because it supports high-quality video formats such as 4K.</p>
<p>OpenShot has several useful audio editing capabilities, including seeing waveforms on the timeline and even displaying the waveform as part of the film. It also allows you to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >separate the sound from the video clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and tune each sound channel separately.</p>
<h3 id="2-OBS-Studio"><a href="#2-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="2. OBS Studio"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>OBS Studio is a free, open-source tool that can be downloaded and installed on Ubuntu and other operating systems such as Windows and Mac. Because it includes a fantastic <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen capturer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, OBS Studio is becoming famous for making videos of Ubuntu or other computer programs. OBS Studio is a basic video editor that lets us blend photos, movies, and music easily.</p>
<p>OBS Studio can create movies in the following formats: Flv, Mkv, mp4, mov, ts, and m3u8. Although the formats are not very open, they are compatible with internet video publishing sites. This editor allows us to modify video rather than merely broadcast it, albeit the editing functionality is not as robust as Kdenlive or Openshot.</p>
<p>OBS Studio also links with video streaming sites to create live videos, unlike other video editing software. This has made it a highly popular software among YouTubers and one that we can download on any Ubuntu version.</p>
<h3 id="3-PiTiVi"><a href="#3-PiTiVi" class="headerlink" title="3. PiTiVi"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pitivi.org/" >PiTiVi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Like many others, this one lets you perform basic video editing activities such as trimming, cutting, snapping, splitting, and mixing. The program also supports several additional languages for those who aren’t fluent in English. You should probably read the manual before using it since it contains a lot of valuable information on using this application.</p>
<p>In a word, the application provides a touch-capable, hardware-accelerated user experience. Limitless video&#x2F;audio track layers, full undo&#x2F;redo history, trimming, cutting, sound editing of several concurrent audio layers upon layer, volume keyframe curves, keyframe audio enhancements, and more are all supported.</p>
<p>Pitivi creates thumbnails and waveforms in the background to provide you with the best performance without interfering with your workflow. Pitivi may be found in most Ubuntu software repositories. If you want, you may also download pre-assembled kits.</p>

<h3 id="4-Kdenlive"><a href="#4-Kdenlive" class="headerlink" title="4. Kdenlive"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://kdenlive.org/en/" >Kdenlive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Kdenlive is, without a doubt, one of the best video editing applications for Ubuntu available right now! What sets it apart from other video editors is that it is completely free and includes several useful features. The MLT Framework, which is based on many other open-source projects, handles most of the video editing in Kdenlive, built on Qt and the KDE Frameworks libraries.</p>
<p>Adjustable layout compatibility, a clip list, a multitrack chronology, automatic backup, keyframe special effects, and transitioning are all included in this video editing program. Do you have a special file format or camcorder? Not an issue — Kdenlive works with practically anything.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that Kdenlive runs on Mac OSX and FreeBSD. Proxy editing is another useful function. This handy function can produce low-quality duplicates of your source clips for quick editing and render them in full resolution.</p>
<h3 id="5-Shotcut"><a href="#5-Shotcut" class="headerlink" title="5. Shotcut"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shotcut.org/" >Shotcut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Another free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor is Shotcut. Unlike Kdenlive, beginner video editors would obtain a comprehensive understanding of Shotcut because of its user-friendly interface. It has indigenous timeline editing, video transitions and filters, and a multitrack timeline, among other things.</p>
<p>Keyframes for digital filters and 3-point editing are supported. Shotcut is useful if you need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >remove the audio from a video clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> rapidly. Additionally, it allows you to edit audio and 4K films. Furthermore, it allows for external monitoring.</p>
<p>JACK transport sync, audio blending throughout all channels, stereo, mono, and 5.1 surround sound capabilities are supported on the audio front. Shotcut is considered ideal for beginners, and if you are one, we would highly suggest getting this one for your Ubuntu.</p>
<h3 id="6-Lightworks"><a href="#6-Lightworks" class="headerlink" title="6. Lightworks"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lwks.com/" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Because the functions go beyond the world of inexperienced editors, this video editor for Ubuntu computers is suited for specialists in video editing. The award-winning non-linear editing (NLE) program can handle 4K, Blu-Ray, and even SD and HD footage. You’ll also discover Low-Res <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Proxy workflows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for 4K and drag-and-drop support alongside those capabilities.</p>

<p>It features voice-over and just added Mackie MIDI compatibility for Ubuntu users. Lightworks supports the most analog and digital connectors, namely 12G, 3G-SDI, Optical audio, HDMI 2, and AES&#x2F;EBU connectors. The creators have also included <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional-level video editing tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and audio filters and enhancements.</p>
<h3 id="7-HitFilm-Express"><a href="#7-HitFilm-Express" class="headerlink" title="7.

This <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >free video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offers most of the same capabilities as top-tier production suites, featuring 4K video capability, 360-degree editing, and hundreds of special effects.</p>
<p>In reality, when it comes to editing capabilities, Hitfilm Express is extremely similar to Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
<p>The major disadvantage of this program is that it consumes a lot of system resources, which means it won’t run on many lightweight laptops. You’ll have to pay extra for things like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >360-degree <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> text, extra color grading facilities, and other aesthetic enhancements, among other things. Hitfilm Express is a video editor that is so strong and simple to use that it’s difficult to believe it’s free. It’s a great option for any video creator on a shoestring budget.</p>
<h3 id="8-VLC"><a href="#8-VLC" class="headerlink" title="8.

It’s not only simple to use, but it also supports a variety of file types without requiring any further purchases or downloads.</p>
<p>It may be used to optimize audio and video on your device of choice. It can play DivC and MPEG streams. You may also watch videos as they’re downloading. It has a basic and easy user interface.</p>
<p>It can be used to start or join a video broadcast. VLC may be controlled via shortcut keys. Some options can be tweaked to suit your tastes. You don’t need to download any codecs to read music or video files. It includes an equalizer built-in that allows users to increase sound quality without altering it.</p>

<h3 id="9-Cinelerra"><a href="#9-Cinelerra" class="headerlink" title="9. Cinelerra"></a>9. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://cinelerra.org/" >Cinelerra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Cinelerra is a video editor for GNU&#x2F;Ubuntu, first released in 1998. It was the first non-linear video editor for GNU&#x2F;Ubuntu that was functional with 64-bit platforms. Cinelerra was a huge hit in its early years since it was a comprehensive and free video editor that was practically unique in its field. However, as time went on, progress slowed, and many users abandoned the project.</p>
<p>Currently, work is ongoing, and new Ubuntu versions are being released in stages. Cinelerra includes a split editing panel that, like Gimp, allows for non-linear video editing. Like all other video editors, Cinelerra provides a variety of video effects and transitions for producing movies and slideshows. We can get Cinelerra from Sourceforge; once we install it, we should run the program using the.&#x2F; command.</p>
<h3 id="10-Blender"><a href="#10-Blender" class="headerlink" title="10. Blender"></a>10. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Like Lightworks and KDenlive, this video editor is geared towards advanced users, but the greatest part is that it is free. It focuses on 3D animation rather than traditional video editing. It’s widely used in 3D modeling, visual effects, animation, simulation, pipeline, and game development.</p>
<p>Blender has filters, transitions, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >keyframes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, adjustment layers, speed control, live preview, histogram displays, luma waveform, and chroma vectorscope for video production. Aside from that, it also allows you to mix, sync, and scrub audio files.</p>
<p>Because all of these functions might be a steep learning curve, it is a little challenging for inexperienced video producers. It is, without a doubt, the finest example of a free and open-source community project. Blender is a free program found in practically any software app store.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Well, there you have it – your best <strong>Ubuntu Video Editor</strong> tools list. Using Ubuntu does not preclude you from installing high-quality apps. Except for the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> described above, there are many other Ubuntu applications available.</p>
<p>A few are geared for pros (such as Lightworks, HitFilm Express, and Blender), while others are designed for beginners (similar to Shotcut and OpenShot). Additionally, because most video editors are currently accessible on the google play store, you would be able to download and install them on your Ubuntu laptop.</p>

<h3 id="1-OpenShot-1"><a href="#1-OpenShot-1" class="headerlink" title="1. OpenShot"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.openshot.org/" >OpenShot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>We are confident that you will not find a more user-friendly video editor than this one. OpenShot is most likely the best choice when you’re new to video production. It is simple to use, but it also has several interesting features.</p>
<p>This editor comes with a plethora of titles and transitions and compatibility for the majority of video and picture formats. You also receive an excellent export option that allows you to save files in various formats. As already mentioned, the application is designed to meet the needs of beginning learners; yet, advanced users will not be dissatisfied because it supports high-quality video formats such as 4K.</p>
<p>OpenShot has several useful audio editing capabilities, including seeing waveforms on the timeline and even displaying the waveform as part of the film. It also allows you to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >separate the sound from the video clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and tune each sound channel separately.</p>
<h3 id="2-OBS-Studio-1"><a href="#2-OBS-Studio-1" class="headerlink" title="2. OBS Studio"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>OBS Studio is a free, open-source tool that can be downloaded and installed on Ubuntu and other operating systems such as Windows and Mac. Because it includes a fantastic <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen capturer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, OBS Studio is becoming famous for making videos of Ubuntu or other computer programs. OBS Studio is a basic video editor that lets us blend photos, movies, and music easily.</p>
<p>OBS Studio can create movies in the following formats: Flv, Mkv, mp4, mov, ts, and m3u8. Although the formats are not very open, they are compatible with internet video publishing sites. This editor allows us to modify video rather than merely broadcast it, albeit the editing functionality is not as robust as Kdenlive or Openshot.</p>
<p>OBS Studio also links with video streaming sites to create live videos, unlike other video editing software. This has made it a highly popular software among YouTubers and one that we can download on any Ubuntu version.</p>
<h3 id="3-PiTiVi-1"><a href="#3-PiTiVi-1" class="headerlink" title="3. PiTiVi"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pitivi.org/" >PiTiVi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Like many others, this one lets you perform basic video editing activities such as trimming, cutting, snapping, splitting, and mixing. The program also supports several additional languages for those who aren’t fluent in English. You should probably read the manual before using it since it contains a lot of valuable information on using this application.</p>
<p>In a word, the application provides a touch-capable, hardware-accelerated user experience. Limitless video&#x2F;audio track layers, full undo&#x2F;redo history, trimming, cutting, sound editing of several concurrent audio layers upon layer, volume keyframe curves, keyframe audio enhancements, and more are all supported.</p>
<p>Pitivi creates thumbnails and waveforms in the background to provide you with the best performance without interfering with your workflow. Pitivi may be found in most Ubuntu software repositories. If you want, you may also download pre-assembled kits.</p>

<h3 id="4-Kdenlive-1"><a href="#4-Kdenlive-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Kdenlive"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://kdenlive.org/en/" >Kdenlive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Kdenlive is, without a doubt, one of the best video editing applications for Ubuntu available right now! What sets it apart from other video editors is that it is completely free and includes several useful features. The MLT Framework, which is based on many other open-source projects, handles most of the video editing in Kdenlive, built on Qt and the KDE Frameworks libraries.</p>
<p>Adjustable layout compatibility, a clip list, a multitrack chronology, automatic backup, keyframe special effects, and transitioning are all included in this video editing program. Do you have a special file format or camcorder? Not an issue — Kdenlive works with practically anything.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that Kdenlive runs on Mac OSX and FreeBSD. Proxy editing is another useful function. This handy function can produce low-quality duplicates of your source clips for quick editing and render them in full resolution.</p>
<h3 id="5-Shotcut-1"><a href="#5-Shotcut-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Shotcut"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shotcut.org/" >Shotcut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Another free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor is Shotcut. Unlike Kdenlive, beginner video editors would obtain a comprehensive understanding of Shotcut because of its user-friendly interface. It has indigenous timeline editing, video transitions and filters, and a multitrack timeline, among other things.</p>
<p>Keyframes for digital filters and 3-point editing are supported. Shotcut is useful if you need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >remove the audio from a video clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> rapidly. Additionally, it allows you to edit audio and 4K films. Furthermore, it allows for external monitoring.</p>
<p>JACK transport sync, audio blending throughout all channels, stereo, mono, and 5.1 surround sound capabilities are supported on the audio front. Shotcut is considered ideal for beginners, and if you are one, we would highly suggest getting this one for your Ubuntu.</p>
<h3 id="6-Lightworks-1"><a href="#6-Lightworks-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Lightworks"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lwks.com/" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Because the functions go beyond the world of inexperienced editors, this video editor for Ubuntu computers is suited for specialists in video editing. The award-winning non-linear editing (NLE) program can handle 4K, Blu-Ray, and even SD and HD footage. You’ll also discover Low-Res <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Proxy workflows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for 4K and drag-and-drop support alongside those capabilities.</p>

<p>It features voice-over and just added Mackie MIDI compatibility for Ubuntu users. Lightworks supports the most analog and digital connectors, namely 12G, 3G-SDI, Optical audio, HDMI 2, and AES&#x2F;EBU connectors. The creators have also included <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional-level video editing tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and audio filters and enhancements.</p>
<h3 id="7-HitFilm-Express-1"><a href="#7-HitFilm-Express-1" class="headerlink" title="7.

This <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >free video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offers most of the same capabilities as top-tier production suites, featuring 4K video capability, 360-degree editing, and hundreds of special effects.</p>
<p>In reality, when it comes to editing capabilities, Hitfilm Express is extremely similar to Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
<p>The major disadvantage of this program is that it consumes a lot of system resources, which means it won’t run on many lightweight laptops. You’ll have to pay extra for things like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >360-degree <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> text, extra color grading facilities, and other aesthetic enhancements, among other things. Hitfilm Express is a video editor that is so strong and simple to use that it’s difficult to believe it’s free. It’s a great option for any video creator on a shoestring budget.</p>
<h3 id="8-VLC-1"><a href="#8-VLC-1" class="headerlink" title="8.

It’s not only simple to use, but it also supports a variety of file types without requiring any further purchases or downloads.</p>
<p>It may be used to optimize audio and video on your device of choice. It can play DivC and MPEG streams. You may also watch videos as they’re downloading. It has a basic and easy user interface.</p>
<p>It can be used to start or join a video broadcast. VLC may be controlled via shortcut keys. Some options can be tweaked to suit your tastes. You don’t need to download any codecs to read music or video files. It includes an equalizer built-in that allows users to increase sound quality without altering it.</p>

<h3 id="9-Cinelerra-1"><a href="#9-Cinelerra-1" class="headerlink" title="9. Cinelerra"></a>9. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://cinelerra.org/" >Cinelerra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Cinelerra is a video editor for GNU&#x2F;Ubuntu, first released in 1998. It was the first non-linear video editor for GNU&#x2F;Ubuntu that was functional with 64-bit platforms. Cinelerra was a huge hit in its early years since it was a comprehensive and free video editor that was practically unique in its field. However, as time went on, progress slowed, and many users abandoned the project.</p>
<p>Currently, work is ongoing, and new Ubuntu versions are being released in stages. Cinelerra includes a split editing panel that, like Gimp, allows for non-linear video editing. Like all other video editors, Cinelerra provides a variety of video effects and transitions for producing movies and slideshows. We can get Cinelerra from Sourceforge; once we install it, we should run the program using the.&#x2F; command.</p>
<h3 id="10-Blender-1"><a href="#10-Blender-1" class="headerlink" title="10. Blender"></a>10. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Like Lightworks and KDenlive, this video editor is geared towards advanced users, but the greatest part is that it is free. It focuses on 3D animation rather than traditional video editing. It’s widely used in 3D modeling, visual effects, animation, simulation, pipeline, and game development.</p>
<p>Blender has filters, transitions, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >keyframes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, adjustment layers, speed control, live preview, histogram displays, luma waveform, and chroma vectorscope for video production. Aside from that, it also allows you to mix, sync, and scrub audio files.</p>
<p>Because all of these functions might be a steep learning curve, it is a little challenging for inexperienced video producers. It is, without a doubt, the finest example of a free and open-source community project. Blender is a free program found in practically any software app store.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Well, there you have it – your best <strong>Ubuntu Video Editor</strong> tools list. Using Ubuntu does not preclude you from installing high-quality apps. Except for the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> described above, there are many other Ubuntu applications available.</p>
<p>A few are geared for pros (such as Lightworks, HitFilm Express, and Blender), while others are designed for beginners (similar to Shotcut and OpenShot). Additionally, because most video editors are currently accessible on the google play store, you would be able to download and install them on your Ubuntu laptop.</p>

<h3 id="1-OpenShot-2"><a href="#1-OpenShot-2" class="headerlink" title="1. OpenShot"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.openshot.org/" >OpenShot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>We are confident that you will not find a more user-friendly video editor than this one. OpenShot is most likely the best choice when you’re new to video production. It is simple to use, but it also has several interesting features.</p>
<p>This editor comes with a plethora of titles and transitions and compatibility for the majority of video and picture formats. You also receive an excellent export option that allows you to save files in various formats. As already mentioned, the application is designed to meet the needs of beginning learners; yet, advanced users will not be dissatisfied because it supports high-quality video formats such as 4K.</p>
<p>OpenShot has several useful audio editing capabilities, including seeing waveforms on the timeline and even displaying the waveform as part of the film. It also allows you to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >separate the sound from the video clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and tune each sound channel separately.</p>
<h3 id="2-OBS-Studio-2"><a href="#2-OBS-Studio-2" class="headerlink" title="2. OBS Studio"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>OBS Studio is a free, open-source tool that can be downloaded and installed on Ubuntu and other operating systems such as Windows and Mac. Because it includes a fantastic <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen capturer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, OBS Studio is becoming famous for making videos of Ubuntu or other computer programs. OBS Studio is a basic video editor that lets us blend photos, movies, and music easily.</p>
<p>OBS Studio can create movies in the following formats: Flv, Mkv, mp4, mov, ts, and m3u8. Although the formats are not very open, they are compatible with internet video publishing sites. This editor allows us to modify video rather than merely broadcast it, albeit the editing functionality is not as robust as Kdenlive or Openshot.</p>
<p>OBS Studio also links with video streaming sites to create live videos, unlike other video editing software. This has made it a highly popular software among YouTubers and one that we can download on any Ubuntu version.</p>
<h3 id="3-PiTiVi-2"><a href="#3-PiTiVi-2" class="headerlink" title="3. PiTiVi"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pitivi.org/" >PiTiVi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Like many others, this one lets you perform basic video editing activities such as trimming, cutting, snapping, splitting, and mixing. The program also supports several additional languages for those who aren’t fluent in English. You should probably read the manual before using it since it contains a lot of valuable information on using this application.</p>
<p>In a word, the application provides a touch-capable, hardware-accelerated user experience. Limitless video&#x2F;audio track layers, full undo&#x2F;redo history, trimming, cutting, sound editing of several concurrent audio layers upon layer, volume keyframe curves, keyframe audio enhancements, and more are all supported.</p>
<p>Pitivi creates thumbnails and waveforms in the background to provide you with the best performance without interfering with your workflow. Pitivi may be found in most Ubuntu software repositories. If you want, you may also download pre-assembled kits.</p>

<h3 id="4-Kdenlive-2"><a href="#4-Kdenlive-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Kdenlive"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://kdenlive.org/en/" >Kdenlive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Kdenlive is, without a doubt, one of the best video editing applications for Ubuntu available right now! What sets it apart from other video editors is that it is completely free and includes several useful features. The MLT Framework, which is based on many other open-source projects, handles most of the video editing in Kdenlive, built on Qt and the KDE Frameworks libraries.</p>
<p>Adjustable layout compatibility, a clip list, a multitrack chronology, automatic backup, keyframe special effects, and transitioning are all included in this video editing program. Do you have a special file format or camcorder? Not an issue — Kdenlive works with practically anything.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that Kdenlive runs on Mac OSX and FreeBSD. Proxy editing is another useful function. This handy function can produce low-quality duplicates of your source clips for quick editing and render them in full resolution.</p>
<h3 id="5-Shotcut-2"><a href="#5-Shotcut-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Shotcut"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shotcut.org/" >Shotcut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Another free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor is Shotcut. Unlike Kdenlive, beginner video editors would obtain a comprehensive understanding of Shotcut because of its user-friendly interface. It has indigenous timeline editing, video transitions and filters, and a multitrack timeline, among other things.</p>
<p>Keyframes for digital filters and 3-point editing are supported. Shotcut is useful if you need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >remove the audio from a video clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> rapidly. Additionally, it allows you to edit audio and 4K films. Furthermore, it allows for external monitoring.</p>
<p>JACK transport sync, audio blending throughout all channels, stereo, mono, and 5.1 surround sound capabilities are supported on the audio front. Shotcut is considered ideal for beginners, and if you are one, we would highly suggest getting this one for your Ubuntu.</p>
<h3 id="6-Lightworks-2"><a href="#6-Lightworks-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Lightworks"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lwks.com/" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Because the functions go beyond the world of inexperienced editors, this video editor for Ubuntu computers is suited for specialists in video editing. The award-winning non-linear editing (NLE) program can handle 4K, Blu-Ray, and even SD and HD footage. You’ll also discover Low-Res <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Proxy workflows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for 4K and drag-and-drop support alongside those capabilities.</p>

<p>It features voice-over and just added Mackie MIDI compatibility for Ubuntu users. Lightworks supports the most analog and digital connectors, namely 12G, 3G-SDI, Optical audio, HDMI 2, and AES&#x2F;EBU connectors. The creators have also included <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional-level video editing tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and audio filters and enhancements.</p>
<h3 id="7-HitFilm-Express-2"><a href="#7-HitFilm-Express-2" class="headerlink" title="7.

This <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >free video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offers most of the same capabilities as top-tier production suites, featuring 4K video capability, 360-degree editing, and hundreds of special effects.</p>
<p>In reality, when it comes to editing capabilities, Hitfilm Express is extremely similar to Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
<p>The major disadvantage of this program is that it consumes a lot of system resources, which means it won’t run on many lightweight laptops. You’ll have to pay extra for things like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >360-degree <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> text, extra color grading facilities, and other aesthetic enhancements, among other things. Hitfilm Express is a video editor that is so strong and simple to use that it’s difficult to believe it’s free. It’s a great option for any video creator on a shoestring budget.</p>
<h3 id="8-VLC-2"><a href="#8-VLC-2" class="headerlink" title="8.

It’s not only simple to use, but it also supports a variety of file types without requiring any further purchases or downloads.</p>
<p>It may be used to optimize audio and video on your device of choice. It can play DivC and MPEG streams. You may also watch videos as they’re downloading. It has a basic and easy user interface.</p>
<p>It can be used to start or join a video broadcast. VLC may be controlled via shortcut keys. Some options can be tweaked to suit your tastes. You don’t need to download any codecs to read music or video files. It includes an equalizer built-in that allows users to increase sound quality without altering it.</p>

<h3 id="9-Cinelerra-2"><a href="#9-Cinelerra-2" class="headerlink" title="9. Cinelerra"></a>9. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://cinelerra.org/" >Cinelerra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Cinelerra is a video editor for GNU&#x2F;Ubuntu, first released in 1998. It was the first non-linear video editor for GNU&#x2F;Ubuntu that was functional with 64-bit platforms. Cinelerra was a huge hit in its early years since it was a comprehensive and free video editor that was practically unique in its field. However, as time went on, progress slowed, and many users abandoned the project.</p>
<p>Currently, work is ongoing, and new Ubuntu versions are being released in stages. Cinelerra includes a split editing panel that, like Gimp, allows for non-linear video editing. Like all other video editors, Cinelerra provides a variety of video effects and transitions for producing movies and slideshows. We can get Cinelerra from Sourceforge; once we install it, we should run the program using the.&#x2F; command.</p>
<h3 id="10-Blender-2"><a href="#10-Blender-2" class="headerlink" title="10. Blender"></a>10. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Like Lightworks and KDenlive, this video editor is geared towards advanced users, but the greatest part is that it is free. It focuses on 3D animation rather than traditional video editing. It’s widely used in 3D modeling, visual effects, animation, simulation, pipeline, and game development.</p>
<p>Blender has filters, transitions, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >keyframes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, adjustment layers, speed control, live preview, histogram displays, luma waveform, and chroma vectorscope for video production. Aside from that, it also allows you to mix, sync, and scrub audio files.</p>
<p>Because all of these functions might be a steep learning curve, it is a little challenging for inexperienced video producers. It is, without a doubt, the finest example of a free and open-source community project. Blender is a free program found in practically any software app store.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Well, there you have it – your best <strong>Ubuntu Video Editor</strong> tools list. Using Ubuntu does not preclude you from installing high-quality apps. Except for the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> described above, there are many other Ubuntu applications available.</p>
<p>A few are geared for pros (such as Lightworks, HitFilm Express, and Blender), while others are designed for beginners (similar to Shotcut and OpenShot). Additionally, because most video editors are currently accessible on the google play store, you would be able to download and install them on your Ubuntu laptop.</p>

<h3 id="1-OpenShot-3"><a href="#1-OpenShot-3" class="headerlink" title="1. OpenShot"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.openshot.org/" >OpenShot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>We are confident that you will not find a more user-friendly video editor than this one. OpenShot is most likely the best choice when you’re new to video production. It is simple to use, but it also has several interesting features.</p>
<p>This editor comes with a plethora of titles and transitions and compatibility for the majority of video and picture formats. You also receive an excellent export option that allows you to save files in various formats. As already mentioned, the application is designed to meet the needs of beginning learners; yet, advanced users will not be dissatisfied because it supports high-quality video formats such as 4K.</p>
<p>OpenShot has several useful audio editing capabilities, including seeing waveforms on the timeline and even displaying the waveform as part of the film. It also allows you to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >separate the sound from the video clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and tune each sound channel separately.</p>
<h3 id="2-OBS-Studio-3"><a href="#2-OBS-Studio-3" class="headerlink" title="2. OBS Studio"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>OBS Studio is a free, open-source tool that can be downloaded and installed on Ubuntu and other operating systems such as Windows and Mac. Because it includes a fantastic <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen capturer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, OBS Studio is becoming famous for making videos of Ubuntu or other computer programs. OBS Studio is a basic video editor that lets us blend photos, movies, and music easily.</p>
<p>OBS Studio can create movies in the following formats: Flv, Mkv, mp4, mov, ts, and m3u8. Although the formats are not very open, they are compatible with internet video publishing sites. This editor allows us to modify video rather than merely broadcast it, albeit the editing functionality is not as robust as Kdenlive or Openshot.</p>
<p>OBS Studio also links with video streaming sites to create live videos, unlike other video editing software. This has made it a highly popular software among YouTubers and one that we can download on any Ubuntu version.</p>
<h3 id="3-PiTiVi-3"><a href="#3-PiTiVi-3" class="headerlink" title="3. PiTiVi"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pitivi.org/" >PiTiVi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Like many others, this one lets you perform basic video editing activities such as trimming, cutting, snapping, splitting, and mixing. The program also supports several additional languages for those who aren’t fluent in English. You should probably read the manual before using it since it contains a lot of valuable information on using this application.</p>
<p>In a word, the application provides a touch-capable, hardware-accelerated user experience. Limitless video&#x2F;audio track layers, full undo&#x2F;redo history, trimming, cutting, sound editing of several concurrent audio layers upon layer, volume keyframe curves, keyframe audio enhancements, and more are all supported.</p>
<p>Pitivi creates thumbnails and waveforms in the background to provide you with the best performance without interfering with your workflow. Pitivi may be found in most Ubuntu software repositories. If you want, you may also download pre-assembled kits.</p>

Kdenlive"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://kdenlive.org/en/" >Kdenlive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Kdenlive is, without a doubt, one of the best video editing applications for Ubuntu available right now! What sets it apart from other video editors is that it is completely free and includes several useful features. The MLT Framework, which is based on many other open-source projects, handles most of the video editing in Kdenlive, built on Qt and the KDE Frameworks libraries.</p>
<p>Adjustable layout compatibility, a clip list, a multitrack chronology, automatic backup, keyframe special effects, and transitioning are all included in this video editing program. Do you have a special file format or camcorder? Not an issue — Kdenlive works with practically anything.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that Kdenlive runs on Mac OSX and FreeBSD. Proxy editing is another useful function. This handy function can produce low-quality duplicates of your source clips for quick editing and render them in full resolution.</p>
<h3 id="5-Shotcut-3"><a href="#5-Shotcut-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Shotcut"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shotcut.org/" >Shotcut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Another free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor is Shotcut. Unlike Kdenlive, beginner video editors would obtain a comprehensive understanding of Shotcut because of its user-friendly interface. It has indigenous timeline editing, video transitions and filters, and a multitrack timeline, among other things.</p>
<p>Keyframes for digital filters and 3-point editing are supported. Shotcut is useful if you need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >remove the audio from a video clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> rapidly. Additionally, it allows you to edit audio and 4K films. Furthermore, it allows for external monitoring.</p>
<p>JACK transport sync, audio blending throughout all channels, stereo, mono, and 5.1 surround sound capabilities are supported on the audio front. Shotcut is considered ideal for beginners, and if you are one, we would highly suggest getting this one for your Ubuntu.</p>
<h3 id="6-Lightworks-3"><a href="#6-Lightworks-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

The award-winning non-linear editing (NLE) program can handle 4K, Blu-Ray, and even SD and HD footage. You’ll also discover Low-Res <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Proxy workflows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for 4K and drag-and-drop support alongside those capabilities.</p>

<p>It features voice-over and just added Mackie MIDI compatibility for Ubuntu users. Lightworks supports the most analog and digital connectors, namely 12G, 3G-SDI, Optical audio, HDMI 2, and AES&#x2F;EBU connectors. The creators have also included <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional-level video editing tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and audio filters and enhancements.</p>

This <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >free video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offers most of the same capabilities as top-tier production suites, featuring 4K video capability, 360-degree editing, and hundreds of special effects.</p>
<p>In reality, when it comes to editing capabilities, Hitfilm Express is extremely similar to Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
<p>The major disadvantage of this program is that it consumes a lot of system resources, which means it won’t run on many lightweight laptops. You’ll have to pay extra for things like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >360-degree <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> text, extra color grading facilities, and other aesthetic enhancements, among other things. Hitfilm Express is a video editor that is so strong and simple to use that it’s difficult to believe it’s free. It’s a great option for any video creator on a shoestring budget.</p>

<p>It can be used to start or join a video broadcast. VLC may be controlled via shortcut keys. Some options can be tweaked to suit your tastes.

<h3 id="9-Cinelerra-3"><a href="#9-Cinelerra-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Cinelerra"></a>9. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://cinelerra.org/" >Cinelerra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Cinelerra is a video editor for GNU&#x2F;Ubuntu, first released in 1998. It was the first non-linear video editor for GNU&#x2F;Ubuntu that was functional with 64-bit platforms. Cinelerra was a huge hit in its early years since it was a comprehensive and free video editor that was practically unique in its field. However, as time went on, progress slowed, and many users abandoned the project.</p>
<p>Currently, work is ongoing, and new Ubuntu versions are being released in stages. Cinelerra includes a split editing panel that, like Gimp, allows for non-linear video editing. Like all other video editors, Cinelerra provides a variety of video effects and transitions for producing movies and slideshows. We can get Cinelerra from Sourceforge; once we install it, we should run the program using the.&#x2F; command.</p>
<h3 id="10-Blender-3"><a href="#10-Blender-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Blender"></a>10. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Like Lightworks and KDenlive, this video editor is geared towards advanced users, but the greatest part is that it is free. It focuses on 3D animation rather than traditional video editing. It’s widely used in 3D modeling, visual effects, animation, simulation, pipeline, and game development.</p>
<p>Blender has filters, transitions, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >keyframes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, adjustment layers, speed control, live preview, histogram displays, luma waveform, and chroma vectorscope for video production. Aside from that, it also allows you to mix, sync, and scrub audio files.</p>
<p>Because all of these functions might be a steep learning curve, it is a little challenging for inexperienced video producers. It is, without a doubt, the finest example of a free and open-source community project. Blender is a free program found in practically any software app store.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Well, there you have it – your best <strong>Ubuntu Video Editor</strong> tools list. Using Ubuntu does not preclude you from installing high-quality apps. Except for the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> described above, there are many other Ubuntu applications available.</p>
<p>A few are geared for pros (such as Lightworks, HitFilm Express, and Blender), while others are designed for beginners (similar to Shotcut and OpenShot). Additionally, because most video editors are currently accessible on the google play store, you would be able to download and install them on your Ubuntu laptop.</p>
