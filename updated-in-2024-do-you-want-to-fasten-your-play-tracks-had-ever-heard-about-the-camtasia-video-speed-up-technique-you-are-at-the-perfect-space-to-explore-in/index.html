<p>With plenty of video tools in addition to cutting, VirtualDub presents an attractive, video toolbox for the enthusiast.</p>
<h4 id="10-Online-Video-Cutter-3"><a href="#10-Online-Video-Cutter-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Online Video Cutter"></a>10. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://online-video-cutter.com/" >Online Video Cutter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Our final offering is a slightly different take on the video cutter. This is an online offering that requires no downloads or installation, you simply go to the website, upload your video or select a video on the web, cut the video and save the output. It is very simple, although there is the obvious issue with larger files of upload and download time, but for many applications is perhaps the ideal solution.</p>

<p>Without the need to install anything, and with a very simple interface, for smaller files is perhaps the perfect solution.</p>
