<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources. Luckily there is no shortage of media players that are compatible with Windows 10, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the <strong>best free DVD players</strong> on the market and help you choose the one that meets all your needs.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10"></a>Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10</h2><p>Before you opt for one DVD player or the other you must first check which audio and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> they support or find out if you can use them to play Blu-ray discs. You should also check a player’s compatibility with the operating system you have installed on your computer and that you have all the codecs necessary to play ISO and other image, audio and video file format. So let’s take a look at ten best free DVD players for Windows 10.</p>
<h3 id="1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan"><a href="#1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan" class="headerlink" title="1. VLC Media Player by VideoLan"></a>1. VLC Media Player by VideoLan</h3><p>Over the course of the last two decades, VLC has established itself as one of the most versatile media players ever created. This cross-platform app can be used on Macs, PCs, Linux computers and Smartphones to play different types of audio, image and video files. In fact, VLC is probably the most reliable <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >DVD player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can find, as it allows you to play DVD and Blu-ray discs effortlessly. However, if you want to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >watch videos in 4K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or 8K resolution, you must install the VLC 3.0 Vetinari update of the media player.</p>
<p>What’s more, playing a DVD or a Blu-ray with VLC is a simple task you can complete in just a few clicks. The Open Disc option that is located in the player’s Media menu enables you to choose if you would like to open a DVD, VCD, Audio CD or Blu-ray disc. Moreover, you won’t need to install additional  or MPEG-4 codecs, since VLC can play the vast majority of video files regardless of the codec they are using.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Available to all PC and Mac users for free</li>
<li>The most versatile media player on the market</li>
<li>Offers basic video editing options</li>
<li>Powerful subtitle syncing tools</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The playback of 4K or 8K video files can be choppy</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-PotPlayer"><a href="#2-PotPlayer" class="headerlink" title="2. PotPlayer"></a>2. PotPlayer</h3><p>If you are looking for a DVD player that is compatible with all versions of Windows that were released since Windows Vista, PotPlayer might be one of your best options. Besides providing support for all commonly used video file formats and allowing you to play DVDs, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Blu-rays <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or audio CDs, PotPlayer also offers support for different types of 3D glasses. This Windows-based media player is equipped with enhanced H&#x2F;W Acceleration technology that enables the software to assist the CPU and GPU during the playback of demanding video files.</p>
<p>PotPlayer has all the codecs that are required for the playback of various types of multimedia files, so you don’t have to waste time searching for the codec packs that make possible playing video and audio content that is stored on DVDs or Blu-rays. The media player lets you choose a sound card in case you have more just than one and it supports SRT and SMI, VOB and Blu-ray subtitles.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Full OpenCodec support</li>
<li>Provides a unique 3D viewing experience</li>
<li>Enables users to bookmark chapters</li>
<li>Compatible with TV, DVD and HDTV devices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Audio playback options could be better</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-BlazeDVD"><a href="#3-BlazeDVD" class="headerlink" title="3. BlazeDVD"></a>3. BlazeDVD</h3><p>This is a powerful multimedia player that enables you to watch even region coded and CSS-encrypted DVDs. However, the free version of BlazeDVD doesn’t allow you to open region coded DVDs and Blu-rays or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add subtitles <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to your files. So if you want to gain access to all the features this DVD player has to offer, you must make a one-time payment of $49.96 and upgrade to its Pro version. Both versions of BlazeDVD let you play DVDs, VCDs or SVCDs and allow you to choose between different playback modes.</p>
<p>The Surround Sound support enhances the audio playback and provides a theater-like experience to the viewers. Moreover, you can choose between ten audio filters you can apply to media files you open with BlazeDVD or use the Parental Control feature if you want to restrict the access to violent content to your children. Creating slideshows from still images or recording videos in an MPEG2 file format are also among the options you are going to have at your disposal if you opt for the paid version of BlazeDVD.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

Now, you just have to manually drag the handle to the exact point from which you want the fade to begin or end. Just keep in mid this simple rule: fade handles at the beginning of a clip produce fade-in effects, whereas fade handles at the end give fade-out effects.</p>
<p>You can manually fade-in or out a portion of the audio clip on your timeline by using the fade handles. Place the pointer over the clip and you can see the fade handles appearing in the top left and right corners of the waveform. To change the sound of the fade, you’ll have to modify the shape of the fade by selecting one of the several preconfigured choices.</p>
<p><strong>Using the fade handles to create crossfades:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> <strong>:</strong> To create a crossfade, first you have to select two adjacent clips in the timeline. After that choose Clip&gt; Expand Audio (or press Control-S). You can see the waveforms on your screen expanding.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> <strong>:</strong> To overlap the audio parts of the two clips on your timeline, just drag the end point of the first clip and the start point of the second clip.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> <strong>:</strong> Now, you’ll have to drag the fade handles of each clip to the exact points where you want the fade to start and finish.</p>

The Final Cut Pro preferences also allow you to adjust the fade duration.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> <strong>:</strong> First, you have to select the audio or the video clips with audio in the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p><strong>Step 2</strong> <strong>:</strong> Select Modify&gt; Adjust Volume&gt; Apply Fades.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Apply fades"
                ></p>
<p>You should remember that the fades appear at the beginning and the end of each clip. The default duration of the fade is one half-second. If you want to modify that duration, you just have to drag the fade handle up to the point where your fade is supposed to begin or end.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Modify duration of fades"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If you want to remove the fades, choose Modify &gt; Adjust Volume &gt; Remove Fades.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fade-Music-by-using-Fade-Handles-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fade-Music-by-using-Fade-Handles-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fade Music by using Fade Handles"></a>Part 2: How to Fade Music by using Fade Handles</h2><p>You have already learned how to find the fade handles on the screen. Now, you just have to manually drag the handle to the exact point from which you want the fade to begin or end. Just keep in mid this simple rule: fade handles at the beginning of a clip produce fade-in effects, whereas fade handles at the end give fade-out effects.</p>
<p>You can manually fade-in or out a portion of the audio clip on your timeline by using the fade handles. Place the pointer over the clip and you can see the fade handles appearing in the top left and right corners of the waveform. To change the sound of the fade, you’ll have to modify the shape of the fade by selecting one of the several preconfigured choices.</p>
<p><strong>Using the fade handles to create crossfades:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> <strong>:</strong> To create a crossfade, first you have to select two adjacent clips in the timeline. After that choose Clip&gt; Expand Audio (or press Control-S). You can see the waveforms on your screen expanding.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> <strong>:</strong> To overlap the audio parts of the two clips on your timeline, just drag the end point of the first clip and the start point of the second clip.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> <strong>:</strong> Now, you’ll have to drag the fade handles of each clip to the exact points where you want the fade to start and finish.</p>

Later in 2003, Final cut pro beats Final Cut Express, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >click to learn why <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. One of the best features that help it stand out from the rest of the video editors is that it is supported by all Mac systems and has permitted Apple to make it fully enhanced in terms of efficiency and speed, enabling it to edit even 4K UND footage without any rendering issues.</p>
<p>Along with such exciting advantages, the video editing tool comes with several disadvantages too. It is complex to understand especially for beginners and most importantly it keeps crashing, corrupting the file even if it is saved properly on your Mac system, which can lead to your entire work being lost. Several Final Cut Pro X users complain that their work gets corrupted as the video editing tool keeps crashing after intervals.</p>
<p>If you can relate to this scenario, you will find this blog post helpful as we have listed some methods that can possibly fix the crashing problem and save your hours of video editing efforts. Keep reading to know the steps that can prevent your video editor from crashing.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Does-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Keep-Crashing"><a href="#Why-Does-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Keep-Crashing" class="headerlink" title="Why Does Final Cut Pro X Keep Crashing?"></a>Why Does Final Cut Pro X Keep Crashing?</h2><p>According to Final Cut Pro X users, the video editor is a reliable and solid program, but it can be really frustrating for them when it keeps crashing. If your Final Cut Pro X video editor and program tool also keep acting up, it can probably be because of the corrupted preferences file.</p>
<p>A corrupted preferences file occurs when you do not reset your preferences and settings in the first place. Not resetting the preferences can corrupt the file and end up crashing the video editing tool, damaging the whole video. All those who want to troubleshoot and require methods to fix the crashing issue should take a few steps to resolve the problem which leads us to our second section.</p>

If you encounter this problem and learn to isolate, troubleshoot, and fix this issue following the below methods, you will likely resolve the crashing problem on your own. However, you should always ensure keeping a back-up of your Final Cut Pro X media, libraries, and applications as a whole in order to keep the data before following the below steps.</p>
<p><img

Resetting preferences will not affect your projects, libraries, or media. With resetting, we mean that you should change the custom preference settings to the default settings. Before you take the plunge to reset your preferences, you should choose Final Cut Pro over Preferences and note all the specific settings that you have to make.</p>
<p>Follow the below steps to reset the preferences in Final Cut Pro X:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Quit working on Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hold down the option and command keys, then open the Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click on the delete preferences option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In the last step, recreate the issue that you were having during video editing. If the problem is resolved, you should open Final Cut Pro preferences and apply the custom settings again.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> And, it’s done!</p>
<p>This method will reset all your preferences to default settings and this way it will empty the list of the recent libraries and media. Though the entire libraries are not erased, you will be able to find them in the specified location when you first created them. But they will only be there if you have created a back-up of your data. That is why we mentioned in the beginning to create a back-up of your Final Cut Pro data in the first place.</p>
<p>With the help of fixing the Final Cut Pro X preferences, you will be able to fix a lot of your problems especially the crashing one. The preferences are deeply embedded into the program operation even if we cannot directly amend most of them.</p>

Here are the steps that you should follow to restart your Mac system:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose the Apple menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Reopen the Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Reproduce the issue and see if the problem still exists.</p>
<p>If your Final Cut Pro X acts up on your Mac system, you should try restarting the system following the aforementioned steps. In case, restarting doesn’t fix the issue, you should apply the first method.</p>
