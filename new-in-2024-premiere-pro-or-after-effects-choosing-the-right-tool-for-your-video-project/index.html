<p>This is perhaps the most asked question regarding video processing on the internet. And looking at the product descriptions on the Adobe site gives us a clue why. There seems to be a large overlap between the two programs, and technically there is, although as we shall see capability doesn’t always mean suitability, so the similarities are not quite as pronounced as they would appear.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it is worth looking at the key differences between <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >After Effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Premiere to get a clearer understanding of what is best for which situation and why you would pick one program over the other. So below are the 9 points that I will make a comparison.</p>

<h2 id="After-Effects-VS-Adobe-Premiere"><a href="#After-Effects-VS-Adobe-Premiere" class="headerlink" title="After Effects VS Adobe Premiere"></a>After Effects VS Adobe Premiere</h2><h4 id="1Timeline"><a href="#1Timeline" class="headerlink" title="1Timeline"></a>1Timeline</h4><p>There are numerous editing differences between the two programs, but we will start with the timeline as it perhaps best illustrates the different focus of each package. Premiere has a very detailed timeline panel with a huge amount of functionality built in to move through and manipulate the contents of a project. After Effects, on the other hand, has less options for dealing with multiple clips and is designed to deal with the composite components in a more user friendly way.</p>
<p>The upshot of this would be the basic premise of the differences, for editing clips into a movie, whilst both can perform the task to an extent, Premiere’s timeline interface makes it a much easier process with many more options to make technical editing easier for the user.</p>

Premiere has a very detailed timeline panel with a huge amount of functionality built in to move through and manipulate the contents of a project. After Effects, on the other hand, has less options for dealing with multiple clips and is designed to deal with the composite components in a more user friendly way.</p>
<p>The upshot of this would be the basic premise of the differences, for editing clips into a movie, whilst both can perform the task to an extent, Premiere’s timeline interface makes it a much easier process with many more options to make technical editing easier for the user.</p>

Premiere has a very detailed timeline panel with a huge amount of functionality built in to move through and manipulate the contents of a project.

<p>The upshot of this would be the basic premise of the differences, for editing clips into a movie, whilst both can perform the task to an extent, Premiere’s timeline interface makes it a much easier process with many more options to make technical editing easier for the user.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the most asked question regarding video processing on the internet. And looking at the product descriptions on the Adobe site gives us a clue why. There seems to be a large overlap between the two programs, and technically there is, although as we shall see capability doesn’t always mean suitability, so the similarities are not quite as pronounced as they would appear.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it is worth looking at the key differences between <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >After Effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Premiere to get a clearer understanding of what is best for which situation and why you would pick one program over the other. So below are the 9 points that I will make a comparison.</p>

These days vertical videos are widely used and they also have a market on social media. But before you are creating these videos vertically, you need to be very careful about the things. Here are some tips that can make your vertical videos even better:</p>
<p><strong>Aspect ratios:</strong> The <strong>Aspect ratio for social media</strong>plays a major role in the success of the videos. This is the reason why aspect ratios are must to understand.

<p><strong>Stay closer to the subjects:</strong> When you are shooting your videos in a vertical frame then it can make easier for you to stay closer to your subjects. As people will be scrolling through the application then your video will be at the center. Sometimes, these videos are cut awkwardly. If you shoot the video properly then you can keep yourself away from such issues.</p>
<p><strong>Grab the attention:</strong> users on social media spend no time to switch to another content or other version of the particular content.

This rule means that you should not keep the subject or object directly in front of the frame. This can look ugly and will not suit every time. Instead of this, you can make the use of imaginary vertical and horizontal lines to create better and interesting composition. This will make you frame divided into thirds. Your subject can be placed on these lines or in between the lines where they are meeting. You can get the feature of using the grid as a guide in most of the cameras and phones.</p>

These days vertical videos are widely used and they also have a market on social media. But before you are creating these videos vertically, you need to be very careful about the things. Here are some tips that can make your vertical videos even better:</p>
<p><strong>Aspect ratios:</strong> The <strong>Aspect ratio for social media</strong>plays a major role in the success of the videos. This is the reason why aspect ratios are must to understand. As far as vertical videos are concerned it can be said that the aspect ratio can be anything just greater than 1:The most recommended aspect ratio for vertical video is 9:16 as it covers the whole screen and also it is more immersive.</p>
<p><strong>Stay closer to the subjects:</strong> When you are shooting your videos in a vertical frame then it can make easier for you to stay closer to your subjects. As people will be scrolling through the application then your video will be at the center. Sometimes, these videos are cut awkwardly. If you shoot the video properly then you can keep yourself away from such issues.</p>
<p><strong>Grab the attention:</strong> users on social media spend no time to switch to another content or other version of the particular content. This is why it becomes so important to catch the attention of your viewers immediately. Try to keep the first couple of moments exceptionally engaging. This will boost the attention of the audience and also make them stay on your video.</p>
<p><strong>Rule of third can benefit you:</strong> If you are wishing to follow this rule then it is important to know the reason behind this rule. This rule means that you should not keep the subject or object directly in front of the frame. This can look ugly and will not suit every time. Instead of this, you can make the use of imaginary vertical and horizontal lines to create better and interesting composition. This will make you frame divided into thirds. Your subject can be placed on these lines or in between the lines where they are meeting. You can get the feature of using the grid as a guide in most of the cameras and phones.</p>

<p>After you’re over with the manual adjustment, click <strong>Back</strong> to go back to the PowerDirector. Now, you can see that an adjustment is made to the selected clip.</p>
<p>Then, you need to click <strong>Apply to All</strong> and see the effect getting added to all the clips on the same track.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Apply color match adjustments at different tracks</strong></p>
<p>Again, apply the same process by left-clicking the video clip on a different track. Select <strong>Fix&#x2F;Enhance</strong> and then go to <strong>Color Director</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, make some adjustments to the <strong>RBG Channel</strong> as we have made it a little brighter here. Then, you need to save this adjustment as Preset to apply to multiple clips simultaneously on different tracks. Hit the <strong>Create</strong> &gt; <strong>Preset</strong> tab as shown in the image below.</p>
<p>Then, you can name the <strong>Preset</strong> and hit on <strong>Save</strong> tab.</p>
<p>After you go back to the PowerDirector, you can see your recently-saved preset in the <strong>Presets</strong> list.</p>
<p>Now, select multiple clips. Left-click on a clip, hold the <strong>Ctrl</strong> key, then left-click on another clip while holding the <strong>Ctrl</strong> key, and so on. You will be able to choose more than one clip in this manner.</p>
<p>Then, check the <strong>Color Presets&#x2F;CLUTs</strong> tab and select the <strong>Preset</strong> that you have saved to apply on multiple clips simultaneously on different tracks.</p>
<p>So, these were the steps of <strong>PowerDirector color match</strong> manual adjustments. We have only adjusted <strong>RGB Channel</strong>, but there are many others to look for and consider.</p>

<p><em>“How good is CyberLink PowerDirector when it comes to automatic color matching?”</em></p>
<p>CyberLink is one of the best video editors with features including motion tracking, screen recording, Multicam editing, etc. It further consists of tools such as titles, transitions, and effects to use quickly. However, we need to talk here about the <strong>PowerDirector color match</strong> process and assess its easiness. No matter how good a video editor is, the process must be simple to understand for the primary users. So, let’s begin with the step-by-step guide on how to color match different video clips in PowerDirector.</p>
<p>The Color Match feature of CyberLink PowerDirector allows matching tones and colors on selected video clips.</p>

<p>The first step to effectively do color matching in CyberLink PowerDirector is to download the ColorDirector. It contains a real camera and color effects to achieve cinematic color match editing.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Apply Presets to multiple clips on singletrack</strong></p>
<p>We assume that you already have clips imported into the timeline. Thus, do a left-click on the first clip, select <strong>Fix&#x2F;Enhance</strong> tab, and then choose <strong>ColorDirector</strong> in the preview window.</p>

<p>Without further ado, let’s note down the automatic color match process in Wondershare Filmora as follows.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-for-Automatic-Color-Matching-Different-Video-Clips-in-Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Steps-for-Automatic-Color-Matching-Different-Video-Clips-in-Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps for Automatic Color Matching Different Video Clips in Wondershare Filmora"></a>Steps for Automatic Color Matching Different Video Clips in Wondershare Filmora</h3><p><strong>Step 1: Download Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, tap the <strong>Try It Free</strong> button to download Wondershare Filmora and proceed with the installation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import media files</strong></p>
<p>Then, import media files. We have imported two stock footage with different color schemes, as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Apply Color Match</strong></p>
<p>Double-click the footage over the timeline and head to the <strong>Color</strong> panel, as shown in the screenshot below. Then, select the <strong>Color Match</strong> option.</p>
<p>Turn on the <strong>Comparison View</strong> and move the slider given in the preview section. To match color settings, click on <strong>Match</strong> and wait a few seconds to let it see the same in both the <strong>Reference</strong> and <strong>Current</strong> preview window.</p>
<p>So, this is all you need to do as an alternative for the <strong>PowerDirector color match</strong>. The color match settings in Wondershare Filmora are relatively automatic and do not require additional RGB Channels adjustments.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-7"><a href="#Conclusion-7" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>After discussing the steps on the <strong>PowerDirector color match</strong> process, we’d now like to mention our final words. To find the easy, effective, and time-saving method, you should first consider the length of steps above in both sections. After the small analysis, you can check up on your favorite way of color matching.</p>
