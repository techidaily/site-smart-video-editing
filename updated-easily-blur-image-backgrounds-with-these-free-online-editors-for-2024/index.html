<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources. Luckily there is no shortage of media players that are compatible with Windows 10, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the <strong>best free DVD players</strong> on the market and help you choose the one that meets all your needs.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10"></a>Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10</h2><p>Before you opt for one DVD player or the other you must first check which audio and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> they support or find out if you can use them to play Blu-ray discs. You should also check a player’s compatibility with the operating system you have installed on your computer and that you have all the codecs necessary to play ISO and other image, audio and video file format. So let’s take a look at ten best free DVD players for Windows 10.</p>
<h3 id="1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan"><a href="#1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan" class="headerlink" title="1. VLC Media Player by VideoLan"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.videolan.org/" >VLC Media Player by VideoLan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Over the course of the last two decades, VLC has established itself as one of the most versatile media players ever created.

<p>What’s more, playing a DVD or a Blu-ray with VLC is a simple task you can complete in just a few clicks. The Open Disc option that is located in the player’s Media menu enables you to choose if you would like to open a DVD, VCD, Audio CD or Blu-ray disc. Moreover, you won’t need to install additional  or MPEG-4 codecs, since VLC can play the vast majority of video files regardless of the codec they are using.</p>

Its video playback features are nothing short of amazing since GOM enables you to play videos in various resolutions and file formats. However, if you would like to use this media player to open Blu-ray discs you must ensure that you have the necessary codecs.

Moreover, the process of playing a DVD with MPC-HC is quite technical as you must adjust the media player’s settings in order to play content from that source.</p>
<p>The codecs you will have to install on your PC depends on the type of content you would like to watch. MPC-HC provides support for  or  codecs, but it is better to install a full codec pack and ensure that you have all the codecs you need to play audio and video files.

<p>Brightening an iPhone video can help you see the activity on-screen and make it more appealing if you share it on social media or post it to a website.</p>
<p>Because the iPhone’s built-in camera app does not enable you to brighten films after they have been recorded, you should always try to light a video before you begin recording.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Switch to video mode by opening the camera app and swiping left. Touch the screen to bring up a box with a sun-shaped symbol.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Move your fingers upward on the iPhone screen to brighten the scene when you begin filming. This may be done at any moment while the video is being recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>There are a ton of <strong>Video Brightening Editor Apps</strong> that will make brightening the videos after filming quite easy for you. Long gone are the days when you had to re-film now and again until you would get that one final shot that has every color adjustment aspect fit to perfection. With the advent of amazing software such as those covered in this article, brightening a dark video has never been easier!</p>
