<li><strong>Enable graphics accelerator</strong>: A graphic accelerator is used in video editing to turbocharge your video exporting. It’s usually clung to a video board of your system. It makes the editing easier and faster by preventing a heavy workload.</li>

<li><strong>Random Access Memory (RAM):</strong> Preferably an 8GB Memory if you’re editing offline, and 32GB Memory if you’re editing online.</li>
<li><strong>Internal storage:</strong> The required storage must be sufficient because 4K videos are huge files.</li>

This free 4k tool provides a proper way of instantly trimming or merging videos without de-coding, which means the video resolution will not be changed. Using the instant cutter tool, you can upload or merge files of huge sizes in different formats, such as  MP4&#x2F;MOV or  MTS&#x2F;M2TS.</p>

Irrespective of the kind of device you’re using to edit your videos, you need to pay attention to some features your device must have. However, these requirements depend on the 4K video editing software free.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</strong> The Processor of the software being used must be Intel Core i7, 2.3Ghz four-core; this is applicable if you will be editing your videos offline. Then, Dual Intel Xeon 2Ghz six-core is applicable if you will be editing your videos online.</li>
<li><strong>Random Access Memory (RAM):</strong> Preferably an 8GB Memory if you’re editing offline, and 32GB Memory if you’re editing online.</li>
<li><strong>Internal storage:</strong> The required storage must be sufficient because 4K videos are huge files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Offline editing refers to editing a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >proxy file of the original source material <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>; online editing is the editing of the original material.</p>

<li><strong>Choose the software based on your hardware:</strong> To choose the best 4K video editing software free, you must not opt for an editing software with higher requirements than your hardware; such software won’t work well on your device. You should instead select an editing software with lower requirements.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Split large 4K videos into several parts</strong></a>: It has been reiterated that 4K videos are huge files; to edit your videos smoothly, it is recommended to split up the videos and edit one after the other. This will save you from heavy data loss.</li>
<li><strong>Enable graphics accelerator</strong>: A graphic accelerator is used in video editing to turbocharge your video exporting. It’s usually clung to a video board of your system. It makes the editing easier and faster by preventing a heavy workload.</li>

<h2 id="Why-You-Should-Use-Video-Hosting-Service"><a href="#Why-You-Should-Use-Video-Hosting-Service" class="headerlink" title="Why You Should Use Video Hosting Service?"></a>Why You Should Use Video Hosting Service?</h2><p>If you intend to host videos on your website, prepare for a myriad of challenges. Hosting videos on one’s website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.</p>
<p>These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.</p>
<p>Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To avoid file format hurdle</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.</p>
<p>Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storage Space and File Size Limitations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.</p>
<p>It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that’s above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantage of the Already Huge Traffic</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>According to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/" >Business of Apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, there are 2 billion monthly active YouTube users. All video hosting service providers have an auto video suggestion feature. Your videos will get views courtesy of traffic from other videos. The more it’s viewed, clicked and rated, the better it ranks.</p>
<p>How to rank videos is little known by video creators. Just upload your high-quality videos and watch it become among the top-ranked in your category.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Help Upload High-Quality Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Most video streaming hosting platforms allow HD (High Definition) video uploads. High Definition videos occupy small spaces and attract more viewers.</p>
<p>To reduce video hosting expenses, free video hosting sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Wistia would be the most suitable. Before you can make select a site, there are important factors that need to be considered.</p>
<p>Here are the best sites and their features;</p>

<p>Love uploaded videos as often as you can? Then, this video hosting platform is not designed for you. With a bandwidth limited to 500GB and maximum video uploads capped at 25 videos, musicians and comedians are quite disadvantaged.</p>
<p>However, if you want a video hosting site for business, Wistia is the best. To embed videos on your website, Wistia automatically generates the video code for you to copy-paste. All videos uploaded are HD (High Definition) and contain no ads on the paid plans.</p>
<p>While many sites are non-interactive, Wistia allows video creators to interact and track leads using Mailchimp, HubSpot, Marketo and Pardot platforms. You can also engage your viewers on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

<p>With only four main categories- entertainment, news, sports and music, these sites aren’t as inviting as Vimeo or Youtube. Dailymotion isn’t limited to only those four categories, just a little confusion; comedy, fashion, wild game shows and live streaming are also included.</p>
<p>However, if you want to benefit from its huge traffic of 237.30 million monthly visitors, upload videos and autosuggestions will help get thousands of viewers. Dailymotion offers viewers select their favourite while allowing partners to earn from the opportunities. And when using the free version, know each video is limited to 4GB.</p>

<p>Vidyard is another online video hosting site for business with both free and paid plans.</p>
<p>The major drawback when using the free plan is the limitations on the number of videos to upload. If your website content requires more than 5 embedded videos a month, upgrade to the paid plans.

Hosting videos on one’s website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.</p>
<p>These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.</p>
<p>Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To avoid file format hurdle</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.</p>
<p>Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storage Space and File Size Limitations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.</p>
<p>It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that’s above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantage of the Already Huge Traffic</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>According to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/" >Business of Apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, there are 2 billion monthly active YouTube users. All video hosting service providers have an auto video suggestion feature. Your videos will get views courtesy of traffic from other videos. The more it’s viewed, clicked and rated, the better it ranks.</p>
<p>How to rank videos is little known by video creators. Just upload your high-quality videos and watch it become among the top-ranked in your category.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Help Upload High-Quality Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Most video streaming hosting platforms allow HD (High Definition) video uploads. High Definition videos occupy small spaces and attract more viewers.</p>
<p>To reduce video hosting expenses, free video hosting sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Wistia would be the most suitable. Before you can make select a site, there are important factors that need to be considered.</p>
<p>Here are the best sites and their features;</p>

<p>Vimeo is an all-round site. It can, therefore, be used as a business and private video hosting site. Three accounts are at anyone’s disposal; free account paid account with plus, Pro, Business and Premium levels and partner account. It’s not as popular as YouTube but is renowned for high-quality videos.</p>
<p>File size and bandwidth are not limited but you can only upload videos of up to 500MB per week. The annual limitation is 25GB. If you want to watch free ad videos, then use the paid accounts. But the good thing with Vimeo is that ads never play between a video.</p>

<p>Love uploaded videos as often as you can? Then, this video hosting platform is not designed for you. With a bandwidth limited to 500GB and maximum video uploads capped at 25 videos, musicians and comedians are quite disadvantaged.</p>
<p>However, if you want a video hosting site for business, Wistia is the best. To embed videos on your website, Wistia automatically generates the video code for you to copy-paste. All videos uploaded are HD (High Definition) and contain no ads on the paid plans.</p>
<p>While many sites are non-interactive, Wistia allows video creators to interact and track leads using Mailchimp, HubSpot, Marketo and Pardot platforms. You can also engage your viewers on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

<p>With only four main categories- entertainment, news, sports and music, these sites aren’t as inviting as Vimeo or Youtube. Dailymotion isn’t limited to only those four categories, just a little confusion; comedy, fashion, wild game shows and live streaming are also included.</p>
<p>However, if you want to benefit from its huge traffic of 237.30 million monthly visitors, upload videos and autosuggestions will help get thousands of viewers. Dailymotion offers viewers select their favourite while allowing partners to earn from the opportunities. And when using the free version, know each video is limited to 4GB.</p>

<p>Vidyard is another online video hosting site for business with both free and paid plans.</p>

Hosting videos on one’s website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.</p>
<p>These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.</p>
<p>Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To avoid file format hurdle</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.</p>
<p>Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storage Space and File Size Limitations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.</p>
<p>It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that’s above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantage of the Already Huge Traffic</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>According to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/" >Business of Apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, there are 2 billion monthly active YouTube users. All video hosting service providers have an auto video suggestion feature. Your videos will get views courtesy of traffic from other videos. The more it’s viewed, clicked and rated, the better it ranks.</p>
<p>How to rank videos is little known by video creators. Just upload your high-quality videos and watch it become among the top-ranked in your category.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Help Upload High-Quality Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Most video streaming hosting platforms allow HD (High Definition) video uploads. High Definition videos occupy small spaces and attract more viewers.</p>
<p>To reduce video hosting expenses, free video hosting sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Wistia would be the most suitable. Before you can make select a site, there are important factors that need to be considered.</p>

It’s not as popular as YouTube but is renowned for high-quality videos.</p>
<p>File size and bandwidth are not limited but you can only upload videos of up to 500MB per week. The annual limitation is 25GB. If you want to watch free ad videos, then use the paid accounts. But the good thing with Vimeo is that ads never play between a video.</p>

<p>Not many people like the many ads but to the entrepreneurs, it’s one of the best video hosting sites for business. They promote their businesses and products and also earn from YouTube. This channel analyses videos and shows the number of viewers, social sharing and related videos.</p>
<p>Verify your account and upload videos of any format of up to 128GB. To watch videos free of ads, subscribe for the premium account. As a free unlimited video hosting site, file size and bandwidth are unlimited but videos cannot exceed 15 minutes</p>

<p>Love uploaded videos as often as you can? Then, this video hosting platform is not designed for you. With a bandwidth limited to 500GB and maximum video uploads capped at 25 videos, musicians and comedians are quite disadvantaged.</p>
<p>However, if you want a video hosting site for business, Wistia is the best. To embed videos on your website, Wistia automatically generates the video code for you to copy-paste. All videos uploaded are HD (High Definition) and contain no ads on the paid plans.</p>
<p>While many sites are non-interactive, Wistia allows video creators to interact and track leads using Mailchimp, HubSpot, Marketo and Pardot platforms. You can also engage your viewers on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

<p>With only four main categories- entertainment, news, sports and music, these sites aren’t as inviting as Vimeo or Youtube. Dailymotion isn’t limited to only those four categories, just a little confusion; comedy, fashion, wild game shows and live streaming are also included.</p>
<p>However, if you want to benefit from its huge traffic of 237.30 million monthly visitors, upload videos and autosuggestions will help get thousands of viewers. Dailymotion offers viewers select their favourite while allowing partners to earn from the opportunities. And when using the free version, know each video is limited to 4GB.</p>

<p>Vidyard is another online video hosting site for business with both free and paid plans.</p>
<p>The major drawback when using the free plan is the limitations on the number of videos to upload. If your website content requires more than 5 embedded videos a month, upgrade to the paid plans.

Hosting videos on one’s website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.</p>
<p>These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.</p>
<p>Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To avoid file format hurdle</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.</p>
<p>Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storage Space and File Size Limitations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.</p>
<p>It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that’s above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantage of the Already Huge Traffic</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>According to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/" >Business of Apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, there are 2 billion monthly active YouTube users. All video hosting service providers have an auto video suggestion feature. Your videos will get views courtesy of traffic from other videos. The more it’s viewed, clicked and rated, the better it ranks.</p>
<p>How to rank videos is little known by video creators. Just upload your high-quality videos and watch it become among the top-ranked in your category.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Help Upload High-Quality Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Most video streaming hosting platforms allow HD (High Definition) video uploads. High Definition videos occupy small spaces and attract more viewers.</p>
<p>To reduce video hosting expenses, free video hosting sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Wistia would be the most suitable. Before you can make select a site, there are important factors that need to be considered.</p>

<p>Vimeo is an all-round site. It can, therefore, be used as a business and private video hosting site. Three accounts are at anyone’s disposal; free account paid account with plus, Pro, Business and Premium levels and partner account. It’s not as popular as YouTube but is renowned for high-quality videos.</p>
<p>File size and bandwidth are not limited but you can only upload videos of up to 500MB per week. The annual limitation is 25GB. If you want to watch free ad videos, then use the paid accounts. But the good thing with Vimeo is that ads never play between a video.</p>

YouTube is owned by Google and is the world’s second-ranked social platform with 27.80 Billion monthly visitors.</p>
<p>Not many people like the many ads but to the entrepreneurs, it’s one of the best video hosting sites for business. They promote their businesses and products and also earn from YouTube. This channel analyses videos and shows the number of viewers, social sharing and related videos.</p>
<p>Verify your account and upload videos of any format of up to 128GB. To watch videos free of ads, subscribe for the premium account. As a free unlimited video hosting site, file size and bandwidth are unlimited but videos cannot exceed 15 minutes</p>

<p>Love uploaded videos as often as you can? Then, this video hosting platform is not designed for you. With a bandwidth limited to 500GB and maximum video uploads capped at 25 videos, musicians and comedians are quite disadvantaged.</p>
<p>However, if you want a video hosting site for business, Wistia is the best. To embed videos on your website, Wistia automatically generates the video code for you to copy-paste. All videos uploaded are HD (High Definition) and contain no ads on the paid plans.</p>
<p>While many sites are non-interactive, Wistia allows video creators to interact and track leads using Mailchimp, HubSpot, Marketo and Pardot platforms. You can also engage your viewers on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

<p>With only four main categories- entertainment, news, sports and music, these sites aren’t as inviting as Vimeo or Youtube. Dailymotion isn’t limited to only those four categories, just a little confusion; comedy, fashion, wild game shows and live streaming are also included.</p>
<p>However, if you want to benefit from its huge traffic of 237.30 million monthly visitors, upload videos and autosuggestions will help get thousands of viewers. Dailymotion offers viewers select their favourite while allowing partners to earn from the opportunities. And when using the free version, know each video is limited to 4GB.</p>

<p>Vidyard is another online video hosting site for business with both free and paid plans.</p>
<p>The major drawback when using the free plan is the limitations on the number of videos to upload. If your website content requires more than 5 embedded videos a month, upgrade to the paid plans.

<h4 id="1-KusoCartoon-3"><a href="#1-KusoCartoon-3" class="headerlink" title="1. KusoCartoon"></a>1. KusoCartoon</h4><p>You can cartoon a photo with the photo to cartoon converter even if you never went through this process before. All you need to do is upload the photo to the platform, pick the cartoon style you like and click on the Photo to Cartoon button.</p>
<p>The platform will automatically apply the effect to your photo and display the results after it cartoons the picture. If you are not satisfied with the results, you can change the cartoon style, reduce or increase the number of colors, and adjust the saturation and brightness values. In addition, the platform lets you decide if the lines in the picture are going to be thick or thin or how intense the shadows are going to be.</p>

In addition to cartooning a photo, you can also use this platform to retouch portraits, enhance photos automatically, or apply different types of visual effects.</p>
<p>You can upload a photo from your computer, your Facebook profile, or the cloud and the platform will cartoonize it as soon as the upload process is completed. In case you don’t like the results you can click on the Adjustments button and open the image in the pho.to’s editor to enhance its colors or apply stickers. However, all photos you cartooned with this photo to cartoon converter are going to be watermarked if you use its free version.</p>

Cartoonize.net</h4><p>You can turn a photo into a cartoon in just a few moments with this platform. Cartoonize.net is going to apply a cartoon effect to a photo you upload automatically, but it also lets you choose from dozens of effects that make photos look like cartoons.</p>
<p>You just have to click on an effect you like in case you don’t like the effect the platform selected for you to apply it. However, you can’t fine-tune the effect’s settings, and some of your photos may not look perfect after you apply a cartoon effect to them. Besides cartooning photos, you can use this platform to perform basic photo editing actions like cropping or rotating, while the platform also offers powerful text tools that enable you to add text layers to photos you cartoon.</p>

<p>You can choose from effects like Cartoon, Toon Cloudy, or Watercolor, and you can just click on the one you like to apply it to your photo. In addition, you can also add text to each photo you cartoonize with the platform and choose a font or the size and color of the text. Moreover, each effect can be adjusted using the Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, and Hue sliders. The only downside is that the platform watermarks all photos you edit with it and you must purchase the PhotoCartoon software in order to remove it.</p>

You just have to upload a photo in order to start converting it. After the picture is uploaded you can adjust Color Improvement, Color Detail, Contour Style, and Contour Strength options.</p>
<p>In addition, you can choose whether or not you want to make a soft drawing. In case you do, you can adjust the Softness Level and Softness Extent values and then click on the Generate button. The platform will take a few moments to cartoonize your photo, but you can only download the photo to your computer since Picture to People doesn’t have social sharing options.</p>
<p>Go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.picturetopeople.org/image/_effects/photo/_cartoon/photo/_cartoon.html" >http://www.picturetopeople.org/image\_effects/photo\_cartoon/photo\_cartoon.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to convert photos to cartoons with the Picture to People converter.</p>

Once you upload a picture from Facebook, your hard drive, or via an URL the platform will generate a preview where you can see how your cartoonized photo looks. Besides the Cartoon effect, this mode also offers the Face Morphing and Face Auto Crop options.</p>
<p>You should click on the Save and Share button if you like the result. However, fine-tuning the effect’s settings isn’t possible, so there isn’t much you can do if you didn’t like the results of cartoonization. Optionally you can open the photo you turned into a cartoon in the platform’s editor and add text layers, stickers or tweak the brightness and contrast values.</p>
<p>Visit <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cartoon.pho.to/" >https://cartoon.pho.to/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to use the cartoon.pho.to tool.</p>

You can then start browsing through the huge collection of cartoon effects.</p>
<p>Once you find the effect you like you should click on it in order to apply it to your photo and then preview the results. Adjusting the effect’s settings is not possible, and some cartoon effects are only available on the desktop version of the app. Moreover, all photos you cartoonize on this platform are watermarked and you must install Prima Cartoonizer on your computer if you want to create watermark-free cartoons from your photos.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Online cartoon photo editors and converters are remarkably easy to use, and they enable you to turn any photo you take into an entertaining cartoon in just a few clicks. However, some of these online platforms watermark your pictures and don’t allow you to adjust the effect’s settings, which impact the quality of the final cartoonized photo.</p>
