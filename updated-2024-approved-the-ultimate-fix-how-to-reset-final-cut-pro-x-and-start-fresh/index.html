<h2 id="How-to-Reset-Final-Cut-Pro-X"><a href="#How-to-Reset-Final-Cut-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="How to Reset Final Cut Pro X?"></a>How to Reset Final Cut Pro X?</h2><p>Final Cut Pro X can be really exciting to use if you also get to know the solutions to reset the video editing tool. There can be several reasons as listed above due to which you may require resetting the tool. Here are a few common methods that can fix the problems and reset the software tool as a whole. We have explained the methods with the help of screenshots for your better understanding.</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Locating-the-Preferences"><a href="#Method-1-Locating-the-Preferences" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Locating the Preferences"></a>Method 1: Locating the Preferences</h3><p>You will require locating the preferences when the Final Cut Pro X keeps crashing. Usually, this program has five different locations where it stores preferences and settings, and that’s from where you can delete the right ones. Located in the library folder, you will find a sub-category of the root level library preferences folder containing the Final Cut Pro System Support folder.</p>
<p>The custom settings folder will contain the presets which you will have to delete. As soon as you find the right folder, you can begin trashing. You can drag the folders to the Trash and empty them then re-open the Final Cut Pro X to see if the problem is settled. If it isn’t, try deleting some more and keep checking the software tool.</p>
<h3 id="Method-2-Deleting-Render-Files"><a href="#Method-2-Deleting-Render-Files" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Deleting Render Files"></a>Method 2: Deleting Render Files</h3><p>Do remember to save your important files before you do this. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Click here to see How to Save Final Cut Pro Project the Right Way？ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>This can come in handy when your timeline does not share or render, or simply crash during playback of the rendered area. These render files in Final Cut Pro X seem to be particularly vulnerable to corruption. If you face any troubles during export or rendering, you should instead delete them in the first place. It should be your first action. In order to successfully do so, you can select the project in the browser and choose the file. After that, you can delete the generated project files.</p>
<p>You can begin deleting the files with just a few unused items, but if you feel that you face more trouble you can delete all the files instead. However, you will not have to delete optimized media or proxy. If the problem remains, you can delete the generated files from the Library or the event.</p>
<h3 id="Method-3-Transferring-Events-to-a-Fresh-Library-Folder"><a href="#Method-3-Transferring-Events-to-a-Fresh-Library-Folder" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Transferring Events to a Fresh Library Folder"></a>Method 3: Transferring Events to a Fresh Library Folder</h3><p>This method can be useful if the library corrupts. You should consider transferring your events to a freshly created Library. The majority of the time, this would resolve the problem. If you cannot open the Library, you can eliminate some specific generated items under the Library bundle’s root level. Ideally removing “Setting.plist” and “CurrentVersion.flexolibrary” are the safe options for removal, which can likely open the Library.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Word"><a href="#Final-Word" class="headerlink" title="Final Word"></a>Final Word</h2><p>Final Cut Pro X can be a very helpful video editing tool until it acts up. Regardless of the reasons for a crashing program, you should consider implementing any of the aforementioned methods to reset the editor, troubleshoot the problems, and seamlessly edit your videos in the long run.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Plugin malfunction:</strong> When the plugin i.e. the feature or effect for the video, is not in working condition, any user cannot edit the video as per their wish.</li>
<li><strong>Black screen while playing video:</strong> During the video editing process, users can experience a black screen on the preview, but the timeline may display the video. This can waste their hours of video editing efforts.</li>

There can be several reasons as listed above due to which you may require resetting the tool. Here are a few common methods that can fix the problems and reset the software tool as a whole. We have explained the methods with the help of screenshots for your better understanding.</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Locating-the-Preferences-3"><a href="#Method-1-Locating-the-Preferences-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Locating the Preferences"></a>Method 1: Locating the Preferences</h3><p>You will require locating the preferences when the Final Cut Pro X keeps crashing. Usually, this program has five different locations where it stores preferences and settings, and that’s from where you can delete the right ones. Located in the library folder, you will find a sub-category of the root level library preferences folder containing the Final Cut Pro System Support folder.</p>
<p>The custom settings folder will contain the presets which you will have to delete. As soon as you find the right folder, you can begin trashing. You can drag the folders to the Trash and empty them then re-open the Final Cut Pro X to see if the problem is settled. If it isn’t, try deleting some more and keep checking the software tool.</p>
<h3 id="Method-2-Deleting-Render-Files-3"><a href="#Method-2-Deleting-Render-Files-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Deleting Render Files"></a>Method 2: Deleting Render Files</h3><p>Do remember to save your important files before you do this. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Click here to see How to Save Final Cut Pro Project the Right Way？ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>This can come in handy when your timeline does not share or render, or simply crash during playback of the rendered area. These render files in Final Cut Pro X seem to be particularly vulnerable to corruption. If you face any troubles during export or rendering, you should instead delete them in the first place. It should be your first action. In order to successfully do so, you can select the project in the browser and choose the file. After that, you can delete the generated project files.</p>
<p>You can begin deleting the files with just a few unused items, but if you feel that you face more trouble you can delete all the files instead. However, you will not have to delete optimized media or proxy. If the problem remains, you can delete the generated files from the Library or the event.</p>
<h3 id="Method-3-Transferring-Events-to-a-Fresh-Library-Folder-3"><a href="#Method-3-Transferring-Events-to-a-Fresh-Library-Folder-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Transferring Events to a Fresh Library Folder"></a>Method 3: Transferring Events to a Fresh Library Folder</h3><p>This method can be useful if the library corrupts. You should consider transferring your events to a freshly created Library. The majority of the time, this would resolve the problem. If you cannot open the Library, you can eliminate some specific generated items under the Library bundle’s root level. Ideally removing “Setting.plist” and “CurrentVersion.flexolibrary” are the safe options for removal, which can likely open the Library.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Word-3"><a href="#Final-Word-3" class="headerlink" title="Final Word"></a>Final Word</h2><p>Final Cut Pro X can be a very helpful video editing tool until it acts up. Regardless of the reasons for a crashing program, you should consider implementing any of the aforementioned methods to reset the editor, troubleshoot the problems, and seamlessly edit your videos in the long run.</p>

<p>We all record more videos with our Smartphones or cameras than we can possibly share on social media, and we often don’t get the chance to show some of our favorite moments to our friends. Video collage apps for iPhones and iPads offer an easy solution to this problem because they enable you to merge multiple video clips into a single video. You don’t even need to have advanced video editing skills in order to create visually stunning video collages, as most of these apps are extremely easy to use. So in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best video collage apps of iOS devices.</p>

Checking the list of features an app offers and making sure that it allows you to adjust each clip you include in a collage separately or to add music to your creations will help you determine if the app you’re interested in is the right choice for you. The selection of video collage presets or the border and background adjustment features should also be considered while choosing a video collage app. Let’s take a look at some of the best video collage apps you can find at the AppStore.</p>

You can either use the existing material from your camera roll or use the Video Collage and Photo Grid app to capture new footage. You can choose from 64 fully customizable layouts and pick the texture or the color of the frames of each video or photo you include in the collage. The app also lets you adjust the sizes of the still and moving images you’re combining and it also offers the possibility to crop photos you’d like to use in your collages. The sound volume can be easily adjusted, but you must make an in-app purchase in order to unlock the background music feature.</p>

<p>This versatile app can be used for much more than just creating video collages, as it offers the option to capture videos in Full HD and 4K resolutions, although the 4K option is only available on iPhone Xs and iPad Pro. Moreover, you can combine several video collages into a single video and apply a variety of transitions to ensure the smooth flow of the output video. Adding text layers, recording voiceovers or creating soundtracks for your video collages are just a few options you’ll have at your disposal if you install the PicPlayPost movie video editor on your iOS-based device. In case you’re planning on using this app on a daily basis, you should consider purchasing the Everything Pack that costs just $24.99.</p>

<p>The fact that PicStich offers more than 300 different layouts speaks volumes about its capabilities. However, the majority of the app’s features are designed to help you create photo collages. You can still add a song you like to a video collage to make it more entertaining to watch, but unfortunately, PicStich doesn’t let you apply transitions or adjust playback speeds of the videos you include in a video collage. Purchasing Frames and Borders packs will extend the scope of your options and enable you to increase the quality of the video collages you’re making. The app’s file-sharing capabilities are impressive since you can export your projects directly to Instagram or Dropbox and you can also share all of your creations to Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social networks.</p>

You should start by choosing one of the pre-designed frames, then you should just import and arrange your videos within the frame and decide whether you want to post the video collage on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook. The free version of VidStich is going to watermark all your creations and it won’t allow you to add music to your collages, which is why purchasing the Pro pack and additional frames and borders will help you produce visual content that is going to impress your followers on social media.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

You can still add a song you like to a video collage to make it more entertaining to watch, but unfortunately, PicStich doesn’t let you apply transitions or adjust playback speeds of the videos you include in a video collage. Purchasing Frames and Borders packs will extend the scope of your options and enable you to increase the quality of the video collages you’re making. The app’s file-sharing capabilities are impressive since you can export your projects directly to Instagram or Dropbox and you can also share all of your creations to Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social networks.</p>

<h4 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h4><p>Now it is time to work on color correction directly. There are three types of color corrections that users need to work upon: Hue, Saturation, and Exposure. Here is some brief information about all of these:</p>
<p><strong>Exposure or Brightness:</strong> On the Color board window you can easily make adjustments for brightness levels of video clips. As you move on to different portions of the image ranging between dark and white parts, the scope will keep on displaying waveforms with values between 0 and 100 representing darkness and brightness respectively. The master slider available on screen helps users to make overall adjustments for brightness by using three control options: highlights for white circles, midtones for gray scale and shadows for black parts. Consider waveform values as a guide for adjustment and move controls up and down to adjust contrast as per need.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" Exposure or Brightness "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Saturation:</strong> It refers to the richness of colors in an image. Simply select saturation pane from the color board and on the video scopes window you can use the settings menu directly to adjust saturation information for every pixel. The image pixels that are far away from the center of vectorscope circle means they are more saturated as compared to pixels that are little bit closure.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" Saturation "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Hue:</strong>  Hue displays the actual color values in images or frames in terms of primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. Use color pane from color board to adjust hue that is displayed in the form of a rainbow on screen. It is possible to manipulate values for highlights, midtones and shadows individually as per need. Using the histogram option available on settings menu can help you to make direct adjustments for all these components.</p>

<h4 id="Step-4"><a href="#Step-4" class="headerlink" title="Step 4"></a>Step 4</h4><p>It is possible to preview all the corrections on the original image before making them final. Simple hit the arrow with left-facing formation in the top left corner of the Color Board and then return to the video inspector. Hit on the Blue box to switch between correction On and Off options.</p>

<p>Most of the advanced camera units these days are capable enough to produce shots with rich quality automatically but still some professionals need to edit captured videos for little color correction. The major reasons behind this additional color correction are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some people need to correct their mistakes on captured videos; it can be due to an incorrect balance of white and due to under or over-exposure at some points.</li>
<li>Customize different video clips by matching them so that they appear in sequence even if they are captured at different moments.</li>
<li>For creating a specific style or look in order to support your mood; for example, one may need to make scenes appear cold, dark, cheery, warm, bright or foreboding.</li>

It can be also done by simply pressing Command+7.</p>

<h4 id="Step-3-2"><a href="#Step-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h4><p>Now it is time to work on color correction directly. There are three types of color corrections that users need to work upon: Hue, Saturation, and Exposure. Here is some brief information about all of these:</p>
<p><strong>Exposure or Brightness:</strong> On the Color board window you can easily make adjustments for brightness levels of video clips. As you move on to different portions of the image ranging between dark and white parts, the scope will keep on displaying waveforms with values between 0 and 100 representing darkness and brightness respectively. The master slider available on screen helps users to make overall adjustments for brightness by using three control options: highlights for white circles, midtones for gray scale and shadows for black parts. Consider waveform values as a guide for adjustment and move controls up and down to adjust contrast as per need.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" Exposure or Brightness "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Saturation:</strong> It refers to the richness of colors in an image. Simply select saturation pane from the color board and on the video scopes window you can use the settings menu directly to adjust saturation information for every pixel. The image pixels that are far away from the center of vectorscope circle means they are more saturated as compared to pixels that are little bit closure.</p>

                      alt=" Saturation "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Hue:</strong>  Hue displays the actual color values in images or frames in terms of primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. Use color pane from color board to adjust hue that is displayed in the form of a rainbow on screen. It is possible to manipulate values for highlights, midtones and shadows individually as per need. Using the histogram option available on settings menu can help you to make direct adjustments for all these components.</p>

<p>Most of the advanced camera units these days are capable enough to produce shots with rich quality automatically but still some professionals need to edit captured videos for little color correction. The major reasons behind this additional color correction are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some people need to correct their mistakes on captured videos; it can be due to an incorrect balance of white and due to under or over-exposure at some points.</li>
<li>Customize different video clips by matching them so that they appear in sequence even if they are captured at different moments.</li>
<li>For creating a specific style or look in order to support your mood; for example, one may need to make scenes appear cold, dark, cheery, warm, bright or foreboding.</li>
</ul>
