<p>Post-production always takes time regardless of how large or small your project is, but that doesn’t mean you can’t start promoting your movie before you complete it. In fact, filmmakers have been using movie trailers for years to inform the audience about their upcoming projects.</p>
<p>There is no need to spend money on a movie trailer maker since the video editing software you’re using to edit the footage can also be used to create trailers for videos you are working on. Even so, there are so many different video editing software products for Macs and PCs, that finding the one that is best suited for your video editing needs can be difficult. That is why in this article we are going to take you through the ten best trailer makers for Mac and Windows operating systems.</p>

Each of the video editing software products we featured in this article grants you access to all the tools you’re going to need to tell your stories, but it is up to you which ones you are going to use to make your next movie trailer. So, let’s take a look at what best movie trailer makers for Mac and PC have to offer.</p>
<h3 id="1-iMovie"><a href="#1-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="1. iMovie"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, iOS</p>
<p>Mac, iPhone and iPad users have a free and easy solution at their disposal if they want to make movie trailers. Besides offering basic video editing tools that enable you to edit your footage quickly, iMovie also features a collection of trailer templates. So, all you need to do in order to make a movie trailer is to add the video clips and insert the title of the movie, the director’s name and create the end credits.</p>
<p>None of the movie trailer templates you can find in iMovie allow you to add music to them, although you can create the soundtrack for your trailer from iMovie’s Movie mode. Furthermore, the templates can limit the maximum duration of your trailer, which is why you must make sure that the video clips you want to use match the duration of the trailer you selected.</p>

<p>Mac, iPhone and iPad users have a free and easy solution at their disposal if they want to make movie trailers. Besides offering basic video editing tools that enable you to edit your footage quickly, iMovie also features a collection of trailer templates. So, all you need to do in order to make a movie trailer is to add the video clips and insert the title of the movie, the director’s name and create the end credits.</p>
<p>None of the movie trailer templates you can find in iMovie allow you to add music to them, although you can create the soundtrack for your trailer from iMovie’s Movie mode. Furthermore, the templates can limit the maximum duration of your trailer, which is why you must make sure that the video clips you want to use match the duration of the trailer you selected.</p>

<p>Windows Movie Maker app makes your home movies totally fun. With the Movie Maker, you may create, share and edit your movies right on the computer. You can also build your own movie with some very simple drag &amp; drops. You can delete the bad shots as well as include just some of the best scenes that you want. After that, you can share the movie through e-mail, Web, and CD. By using any third party application you can also take the movies you have made and turn it in the DVDs. You may as well save the movie back to your video tape in the camera so that you can play back on the TV or on camera itself.</p>

<p>(VideoLAN Movie Creator or VLMC is the free video editing program, giving features to get semi-professional quality films, however with an aim to stay user-friendly and simple. Developers of the most famous video players in world, the VLC Media Player, now have started the new and promising project: called Videolan Movie Creator. It is “promising” because the Videolan Movie Creator still is at the early stage of the development. From the developers, it is just the pre-alpha release, and with many important features missing &amp; plenty of bugs. However, they are taking a close look on it that nobody could resist this temptation! Testing Videolan Movie Creator is an adventure. Program still is unstable &amp; buggy, thus expect some crashes.</p>

<p>PiTiVi is the open source editor, written in the Python and based at GStreamer &amp; GTK+. Taking in account a fact that not everyone has similar knowledge of the video editing, and nor same requirements, PiTIVi gives many ways of modifying and creating the timeline. Ranging from the simple synopsis view to full editing view (or Complex View) puts you in total control of editing. PiTiVi may encode and capture video and audio, trim and split video clips, enhance and trim audio &amp; render projects at any format that is supported by GStreamer framework. The PiTiVi was been added by kn (the Contributor) at 17&#x2F;04&#x2F;2009 and latest change was made</p>

<p>Cinelerra is the highly professional and advanced video editing program, however still remains the open source. Cinelerra will solve 3 important tasks: capturing, compositing and editing. There is no limit to video resolution thus whether it is standard or HD does not really matter at Cinelerra. Cinelerra always has been free and may remain so since developers are working very closely with traditional technical design &amp; manufacturing companies and media and broadcast production companies all along with the Independent Artists &amp; Technologists to bring some new capabilities and higher functionality. We know that Cinelerra isn’t perfect, however, it’s one platform that we can build on together to make our independent and professional studios.</p>
