<h2 id="GoPro-Quik-PC-An-Overview"><a href="#GoPro-Quik-PC-An-Overview" class="headerlink" title="GoPro Quik PC- An Overview"></a><strong>GoPro Quik PC- An Overview</strong></h2><p>Do you need an app for editing GoPro videos and photos? If the answer is yes, then you should go for GoPro Quik for Desktop. GoPro Quik is a video editing software that allows you to edit your GoPro videos and photos within no time. The app comes with a very simple user interface that will help you quickly edit your videos. GoPro Quik for desktop was created to meet your basic needs and wants when it comes to editing GoPro photos and videos. You can easily edit your GoPro photos and videos using this app. This app will help you in creating post-production videos like a pro.</p>
<p>The best thing about GoPro Quick for Desktop is that it is free to use and is available easily for both 32 bit and 64 bit systems. It also has a simple and intuitive interface that anyone can adopt, even if you don’t have any prior experience with this video editing app. It basically allows you to import your GoPro clips, highlight your favorite clips, and then it edits your video for you–including adding music. The process is pretty quick, as the name suggests.</p>
<h2 id="GoPro-Quik-Windows-Features"><a href="#GoPro-Quik-Windows-Features" class="headerlink" title="GoPro Quik Windows Features"></a><strong>GoPro Quik Windows Features</strong></h2><p>GoPro Quik app is rich with features, and it provides pretty much everything that you need to create amazing photos and videos. A few highlighting features are discussed below:</p>
<h3 id="1-Create-Amazing-Videos-In-Just-A-Few-Clicks"><a href="#1-Create-Amazing-Videos-In-Just-A-Few-Clicks" class="headerlink" title="1.Create Amazing Videos In Just A Few Clicks"></a>1.Create Amazing Videos In Just A Few Clicks</h3><p>With GoPro Quik, making amazing videos is very easy. With just a few clicks, you can import all your videos and photos. Then you can edit them in just a few clicks. Everything here is so simple that you will feel like a pro video editor yourself.</p>
<h3 id="2-Auto-Cloud-Uploads"><a href="#2-Auto-Cloud-Uploads" class="headerlink" title="2.Auto Cloud Uploads"></a>2.Auto Cloud Uploads</h3><p>Another amazing feature of GoPro Quik is that once you have done editing your videos, they will be automatically uploaded to your cloud. But for this feature to work, make sure that you have an active GoPro PLUS subscription.</p>
<h3 id="3-Excellent-editing"><a href="#3-Excellent-editing" class="headerlink" title="3.Excellent editing"></a>3.Excellent editing</h3><p>Simply click a few buttons to turn GoPro footage into an awesome video. Pick the perfect soundtrack, then pick your favorite moments. Your video automatically syncs with the music, so you can share it in just a few seconds. Make your videos come alive with panning effects by adding photos and time-lapse sequences.</p>
<h3 id="4-Share-with-friends"><a href="#4-Share-with-friends" class="headerlink" title="4.Share with friends"></a>4.Share with friends</h3><p>Make short videos that are ideal for posting on Facebook, YouTube, and more. Make a unique video from your burst and timelapse photos. Additionally, you can find and save the most memorable moments in a video, then share them as high-quality still images.</p>
<h3 id="5-New-Speed-Tool"><a href="#5-New-Speed-Tool" class="headerlink" title="5.New Speed Tool"></a>5.New Speed Tool</h3><p>Tap the pencil to choose the Speed icon for the video in your Media Mural. Then you can apply more than one-speed effect simultaneously. The speed can be toggled between real-time and half-speed slow motion. You can also add freeze frames for a specified period of time.</p>
<h3 id="6-GoPro-Exclusive-filters"><a href="#6-GoPro-Exclusive-filters" class="headerlink" title="6.GoPro-Exclusive filters"></a>6.GoPro-Exclusive filters</h3><p>From Media or Mural, select a photo or video and tap the pencil. In order to optimize the footage to the environment it was shot in, GoPro has created 25 filters in-house. By using the scrub bar, you can adjust the intensity of each filter.</p>
<h3 id="7-Premium-Themes"><a href="#7-Premium-Themes" class="headerlink" title="7.Premium Themes"></a>7.Premium Themes</h3><p>Alternatively, you may create a new highlight from Media. You will be presented with 13 video editing themes. Besides adding text and transitions, you can also change the music, choose the duration, and choose the right format for your intended sharing platform, such as social media or text.</p>
<h5 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Despite its ease and quickness, there are a few drawbacks to it. First, I must say this is awesome and perfect for anyone who has never edited a GoPro video before. When you’re new to video editing software, it can be very easy to become frustrated and overwhelmed, so it’s great for those who aren’t familiar with it. It’s all about getting that video off your memory card and putting it out there. That’s it.</p>
<h5 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>You cannot edit footage from your phone or DSLR with Quik App for Desktop - only GoPro footage can be used in Quik App. This is a GoPro app, after all. It should be used with GoPro content!</p>
<p>In addition to the ten free songs, GoPro Plus members have access to an additional song library. Users cannot import their own music either.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may only create a certain number of Highlights. Each 30-second video is limited to 10 Highlights.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p>Although GoPro Quik is amazing and comes with a lot of features, there are still many limitations of this application, as discussed in the cons section of this article. If you want to do basic editing, then this app will do just good, but if you are looking for advanced features like audio normalization, keyframing, color tuning, gif support, etc., then you will have to use another fully-fledged video editing app. We recommend you to give a try to our <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> video editor.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Clayframes wasn’t updated in years, it is still one of the best stop motion apps for Android Smartphones. You can either capture new footage or import the images you want to use in your stop motion video, and arrange them in any way you want.

Optionally, you can draw over the photos you take with Clayframes, and preview your footage at different frame rates without having to export it.

<p>Inexperienced photographers who are still learning how to make stop motion animations should consider installing PicPac Stop Motion &amp; Time Lapse on their Android phones. The features this app offers may not be the most powerful, but you can still use them to create a smooth stop motion animation. The app’s Timelapse-manual mode enables you to take a new photo each time you make a loud noise and you can also record voiceovers or create soundtracks for your videos with PicPac. The app lets you share all of your creations on YouTube, but only if you are signed in to your account. Furthermore, the free version of PicPac watermarks all your videos and it doesn’t allow you to export videos in resolutions larger than 360p. That’s why you must upgrade to the pro version of the app if you want to create stop motion animations with it on a constant basis.</p>

<p>Making a stop motion video with this app is a straightforward process that can be completed in just a few easy steps. After you launch the app and tap on the Create button, the device’s camera will open and you just have to press the camera button each time you want to make a new frame. Tap on the Done button once you complete the sequence of images, so you just have to preview the result before proceeding to export the video. The app doesn’t allow you to record voiceovers or create soundtracks, and you must use another video editing app for iOS devices if you want to edit a stop motion video further. It is worth noting that you must give Stop Motion Maker access to your phone’s camera and photo library in order for it to function properly.</p>

After you’ve created your Minecraft world, you can start capturing it with Stop Motion Movie Creator. The app is equipped with an onion skin tool and guides that show you how to move the objects on the screen which makes the process of creating a stop motion animation much easier.

<p>Life Lapse is probably one of the best stop motion apps ever created because it offers all the tools you need to shoot and edit a stop motion animation. Focus, white balance and exposure lock, ghosted image overlay or interval timers are just a few among countless options you can use while shooting a stop motion video. Optionally, you can import photos and use the app’s video editing tools to adjust frame rates, apply visual effects or create soundtracks from royalty-free songs. Life Lapse grants you access to color correction tools, which enables you to set saturation, brightness, contrast or white balance values manually for each frame you include in the stop motion video you are making. You must upgrade to the app’s pro version if you want to record footage in 4K resolution, import audio files to your projects or export videos without a watermark.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a simple app that lets you take image sequences with ease, you shouldn’t look much further than Frameographer. You can choose if you want record stop motion videos with iPhone’s front or rear cameras in 1080p or 720p resolutions. Additionally, you can enable or disable a grid that helps you compose shots or lock the focus and exposure. Frameographer also features a low-light Boost mode, which enables you to make stop motion or time lapse videos under low light conditions. The app lets you add new frames to projects you already created so that you don’t have to complete all the work on a stop motion video at once. Frameographer lets you use songs from your iTunes music library, but the lack of video editing features makes this app a relatively poor choice for video content creators who want to edit their footage quickly before posting it on social media.</p>

<p>Photographers who like shooting time-lapses and stop motion videos with their iPhones can benefit from installing Osnap! Pro on their devices. Besides offering presets that enable you to complete projects quickly, this app is also equipped with features you need to control camera settings manually. Osnap! Pro lets you shoot in 4K or Full HD resolutions, and you can choose if you want to create a vertically or horizontally oriented video or set an aspect ratio that best fits your project. The app allows you to trigger the photo capture feature using loud sounds and even set reminders that notify you when you are supposed to take a new photo. However, if you want to import photos from your device, record voiceovers or transfer footage via WiFi you must make in-app purchases.</p>

<p>This app offers only a standard set of stop motion tools, such as onion skin or instant playback, which makes it largely overpriced as it fails to offer any of the advanced stop motion photography options. What’s more, you have to install an additional app if you want to snap photos remotely and you won’t have access to any photo editing options. Rearranging the frames you add to the timeline isn’t possible and the app doesn’t even have the undo option. The app offers audio recording features, which enables you to create voiceovers for your videos, and you can import audio files you would like to include in your soundtrack. Even so, iStopMotion is far from being a perfect stop motion app, as there are many better options you can find on App Store.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Recording and editing stop motion animations from Smartphones and tablets has never been easier.

Focus, white balance and exposure lock, ghosted image overlay or interval timers are just a few among countless options you can use while shooting a stop motion video. Optionally, you can import photos and use the app’s video editing tools to adjust frame rates, apply visual effects or create soundtracks from royalty-free songs. Life Lapse grants you access to color correction tools, which enables you to set saturation, brightness, contrast or white balance values manually for each frame you include in the stop motion video you are making. You must upgrade to the app’s pro version if you want to record footage in 4K resolution, import audio files to your projects or export videos without a watermark.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a simple app that lets you take image sequences with ease, you shouldn’t look much further than Frameographer. You can choose if you want record stop motion videos with iPhone’s front or rear cameras in 1080p or 720p resolutions. Additionally, you can enable or disable a grid that helps you compose shots or lock the focus and exposure. Frameographer also features a low-light Boost mode, which enables you to make stop motion or time lapse videos under low light conditions. The app lets you add new frames to projects you already created so that you don’t have to complete all the work on a stop motion video at once. Frameographer lets you use songs from your iTunes music library, but the lack of video editing features makes this app a relatively poor choice for video content creators who want to edit their footage quickly before posting it on social media.</p>

<p>Photographers who like shooting time-lapses and stop motion videos with their iPhones can benefit from installing Osnap! Pro on their devices. Besides offering presets that enable you to complete projects quickly, this app is also equipped with features you need to control camera settings manually. Osnap! Pro lets you shoot in 4K or Full HD resolutions, and you can choose if you want to create a vertically or horizontally oriented video or set an aspect ratio that best fits your project. The app allows you to trigger the photo capture feature using loud sounds and even set reminders that notify you when you are supposed to take a new photo. However, if you want to import photos from your device, record voiceovers or transfer footage via WiFi you must make in-app purchases.</p>

<p>This app offers only a standard set of stop motion tools, such as onion skin or instant playback, which makes it largely overpriced as it fails to offer any of the advanced stop motion photography options. What’s more, you have to install an additional app if you want to snap photos remotely and you won’t have access to any photo editing options. Rearranging the frames you add to the timeline isn’t possible and the app doesn’t even have the undo option. The app offers audio recording features, which enables you to create voiceovers for your videos, and you can import audio files you would like to include in your soundtrack. Even so, iStopMotion is far from being a perfect stop motion app, as there are many better options you can find on App Store.</p>

<p>There are a lot of different types of stop motion animations, and you must make sure that the app you install on your Smartphone has all the tools you need to make the video you want. Moreover, you should consider getting the accessories for your Smartphone that will make shooting a stop motion video easier. Let’s take a look at the ten best stop motion apps for iOS and Android devices.</p>
<p>In most cases, the editing features are limited on mobile phones.

<li>Import all your stop motion images, and adjust the photo duration to 1 frame length under the Preference settings.</li>
</ol>

<p>This cross-platform app is equipped with a versatile set of stop motion animation tools that grant you complete control over all camera settings. You can adjust the white balance, ISO, and exposure manually, while the app also allows you to choose if you want to use manual or auto focus. Furthermore, Stop Motion Studio offers animation guides that enable its users to move the objects in the shot with more precision, while the app’s timeline makes it easy to navigate through large numbers of frames. Changing backgrounds, applying visual effects or creating soundtracks are just a few among numerous options Stop Motion Studio offers. Apple Watch can be used as a remote shutter release on the iOS version of the app, and you can also pair it with all DSLR cameras that have WiFi. Even though installing Stop Motion Studio on an iPhone, iPad or an Android Smartphone won’t cost you anything, you must make in-app purchases if you want to export your projects in 4K resolution or import images into the app.</p>
<h3 id="2-Clayframes-2"><a href="#2-Clayframes-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Clayframes"></a>2. Clayframes</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong>  $2.28</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Clayframes wasn’t updated in years, it is still one of the best stop motion apps for Android Smartphones. You can either capture new footage or import the images you want to use in your stop motion video, and arrange them in any way you want. The app’s erase tool allows you to remove rigs and all other objects you don’t want to keep in the shot. Clayframes is equipped with timed shutter release options that enable you to choose how frequently the app is going to take photos. Optionally, you can draw over the photos you take with Clayframes, and preview your footage at different frame rates without having to export it. Once you’re done making a stop motion animation, you can choose the resolution in which the video is going to be exported and decide if you want to share the video you created to Facebook or YouTube directly from the app.</p>

<p>Inexperienced photographers who are still learning how to make stop motion animations should consider installing PicPac Stop Motion &amp; Time Lapse on their Android phones. The features this app offers may not be the most powerful, but you can still use them to create a smooth stop motion animation. The app’s Timelapse-manual mode enables you to take a new photo each time you make a loud noise and you can also record voiceovers or create soundtracks for your videos with PicPac. The app lets you share all of your creations on YouTube, but only if you are signed in to your account. Furthermore, the free version of PicPac watermarks all your videos and it doesn’t allow you to export videos in resolutions larger than 360p. That’s why you must upgrade to the pro version of the app if you want to create stop motion animations with it on a constant basis.</p>

<p>iPhone and iPad owners who would like to create time lapse and stop motion videos from the same app can try using iMotion. The app has Time-Lapse, Manual, WiFi Remote and Photo Library Import modes, and you can easily choose the one that best meets the demands of your project. What’s more, iMotion lets you decide if you want to capture footage with a front or rear camera and it allows you to control focus, exposure or white balance manually. The maximum duration of a stop motion movie is not limited, and you can also preview your projects at different frame rates. All projects you create with iMotion can be exported in 4K, 1080p or 720p resolutions, although shooting in 4K is only possible on newer versions of iPhones and iPads. The free version of iMotion offers only a limited range of options, and you must purchase the full version of the app if you want to use all the tools it has to offer</p>

<p>Making a stop motion video with this app is a straightforward process that can be completed in just a few easy steps. After you launch the app and tap on the Create button, the device’s camera will open and you just have to press the camera button each time you want to make a new frame. Tap on the Done button once you complete the sequence of images, so you just have to preview the result before proceeding to export the video. The app doesn’t allow you to record voiceovers or create soundtracks, and you must use another video editing app for iOS devices if you want to edit a stop motion video further. It is worth noting that you must give Stop Motion Maker access to your phone’s camera and photo library in order for it to function properly.</p>

In addition, you can apply a variety of visual effects to all images you take with this app or even add the end credits to the video. Stop Motion Movie Creator grants you access to the music and sound effects from the video game, which enables you to create perfect soundtracks for the videos you make with this app. The best part is that you don’t have to create Minecraft-inspired stop motion animations since the app enables you to make videos using clay figures or Lego bricks.</p>

<p>There are a lot of different types of stop motion animations, and you must make sure that the app you install on your Smartphone has all the tools you need to make the video you want. Moreover, you should consider getting the accessories for your Smartphone that will make shooting a stop motion video easier. Let’s take a look at the ten best stop motion apps for iOS and Android devices.</p>
<p>In most cases, the editing features are limited on mobile phones. If you are looking for some desktop video editing software to create stop motion videos, I recommend you to try this easy-to-use yet powerful <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

<p>This cross-platform app is equipped with a versatile set of stop motion animation tools that grant you complete control over all camera settings. You can adjust the white balance, ISO, and exposure manually, while the app also allows you to choose if you want to use manual or auto focus. Furthermore, Stop Motion Studio offers animation guides that enable its users to move the objects in the shot with more precision, while the app’s timeline makes it easy to navigate through large numbers of frames. Changing backgrounds, applying visual effects or creating soundtracks are just a few among numerous options Stop Motion Studio offers. Apple Watch can be used as a remote shutter release on the iOS version of the app, and you can also pair it with all DSLR cameras that have WiFi. Even though installing Stop Motion Studio on an iPhone, iPad or an Android Smartphone won’t cost you anything, you must make in-app purchases if you want to export your projects in 4K resolution or import images into the app.</p>
<h3 id="2-Clayframes-3"><a href="#2-Clayframes-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Clayframes"></a>2. Clayframes</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong>  $2.28</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.educationalappstore.com/app/clayframes-lite-stop-motion" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

<p>Despite the fact that Clayframes wasn’t updated in years, it is still one of the best stop motion apps for Android Smartphones. You can either capture new footage or import the images you want to use in your stop motion video, and arrange them in any way you want. The app’s erase tool allows you to remove rigs and all other objects you don’t want to keep in the shot. Clayframes is equipped with timed shutter release options that enable you to choose how frequently the app is going to take photos. Optionally, you can draw over the photos you take with Clayframes, and preview your footage at different frame rates without having to export it. Once you’re done making a stop motion animation, you can choose the resolution in which the video is going to be exported and decide if you want to share the video you created to Facebook or YouTube directly from the app.</p>

<p><strong>User Ratings:</strong>  4.0</p>
<p>Inexperienced photographers who are still learning how to make stop motion animations should consider installing PicPac Stop Motion &amp; Time Lapse on their Android phones. The features this app offers may not be the most powerful, but you can still use them to create a smooth stop motion animation. The app’s Timelapse-manual mode enables you to take a new photo each time you make a loud noise and you can also record voiceovers or create soundtracks for your videos with PicPac. The app lets you share all of your creations on YouTube, but only if you are signed in to your account. Furthermore, the free version of PicPac watermarks all your videos and it doesn’t allow you to export videos in resolutions larger than 360p. That’s why you must upgrade to the pro version of the app if you want to create stop motion animations with it on a constant basis.</p>
<h3 id="4-iMotion-3"><a href="#4-iMotion-3" class="headerlink" title="4. iMotion"></a>4. iMotion</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong>  Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>

<p><strong>User Ratings:</strong>  4.4</p>
<p>iPhone and iPad owners who would like to create time lapse and stop motion videos from the same app can try using iMotion. The app has Time-Lapse, Manual, WiFi Remote and Photo Library Import modes, and you can easily choose the one that best meets the demands of your project. What’s more, iMotion lets you decide if you want to capture footage with a front or rear camera and it allows you to control focus, exposure or white balance manually. The maximum duration of a stop motion movie is not limited, and you can also preview your projects at different frame rates. All projects you create with iMotion can be exported in 4K, 1080p or 720p resolutions, although shooting in 4K is only possible on newer versions of iPhones and iPads. The free version of iMotion offers only a limited range of options, and you must purchase the full version of the app if you want to use all the tools it has to offer</p>
<h3 id="5-Stop-Motion-Maker-3"><a href="#5-Stop-Motion-Maker-3" class="headerlink" title="5.Stop Motion Maker"></a>5.Stop Motion Maker</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong>  Free, offers in-app purchases</p>

<p>Making a stop motion video with this app is a straightforward process that can be completed in just a few easy steps. After you launch the app and tap on the Create button, the device’s camera will open and you just have to press the camera button each time you want to make a new frame. Tap on the Done button once you complete the sequence of images, so you just have to preview the result before proceeding to export the video. The app doesn’t allow you to record voiceovers or create soundtracks, and you must use another video editing app for iOS devices if you want to edit a stop motion video further. It is worth noting that you must give Stop Motion Maker access to your phone’s camera and photo library in order for it to function properly.</p>

<p>This is a must-have app for all passionate Minecraft players, as it allows them to create stop motion animations that feature all of their favorite characters. After you’ve created your Minecraft world, you can start capturing it with Stop Motion Movie Creator. The app is equipped with an onion skin tool and guides that show you how to move the objects on the screen which makes the process of creating a stop motion animation much easier. In addition, you can apply a variety of visual effects to all images you take with this app or even add the end credits to the video. Stop Motion Movie Creator grants you access to the music and sound effects from the video game, which enables you to create perfect soundtracks for the videos you make with this app. The best part is that you don’t have to create Minecraft-inspired stop motion animations since the app enables you to make videos using clay figures or Lego bricks.</p>

<p><strong>User Ratings:</strong>  4.8 on App Store, 3.6 on Google Play</p>
<p>Life Lapse is probably one of the best stop motion apps ever created because it offers all the tools you need to shoot and edit a stop motion animation. Focus, white balance and exposure lock, ghosted image overlay or interval timers are just a few among countless options you can use while shooting a stop motion video. Optionally, you can import photos and use the app’s video editing tools to adjust frame rates, apply visual effects or create soundtracks from royalty-free songs. Life Lapse grants you access to color correction tools, which enables you to set saturation, brightness, contrast or white balance values manually for each frame you include in the stop motion video you are making. You must upgrade to the app’s pro version if you want to record footage in 4K resolution, import audio files to your projects or export videos without a watermark.</p>
<h3 id="8-Frameographer-3"><a href="#8-Frameographer-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Frameographer"></a>8. Frameographer</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong>  $4.99</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/frameographer-stop-motion/id503347879" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p><strong>User Ratings:</strong>  3.4</p>
<p>If you are looking for a simple app that lets you take image sequences with ease, you shouldn’t look much further than Frameographer. You can choose if you want record stop motion videos with iPhone’s front or rear cameras in 1080p or 720p resolutions. Additionally, you can enable or disable a grid that helps you compose shots or lock the focus and exposure. Frameographer also features a low-light Boost mode, which enables you to make stop motion or time lapse videos under low light conditions. The app lets you add new frames to projects you already created so that you don’t have to complete all the work on a stop motion video at once. Frameographer lets you use songs from your iTunes music library, but the lack of video editing features makes this app a relatively poor choice for video content creators who want to edit their footage quickly before posting it on social media.</p>
<h3 id="9-Osnap-Pro-3"><a href="#9-Osnap-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Osnap! Pro"></a>9. Osnap! Pro</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong>  $4.99, offers in-app purchases</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/osnap-ultimate-time-lapse/id457402095" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p><strong>User Ratings:</strong>  4.7</p>
<p>Photographers who like shooting time-lapses and stop motion videos with their iPhones can benefit from installing Osnap! Pro on their devices. Besides offering presets that enable you to complete projects quickly, this app is also equipped with features you need to control camera settings manually. Osnap! Pro lets you shoot in 4K or Full HD resolutions, and you can choose if you want to create a vertically or horizontally oriented video or set an aspect ratio that best fits your project. The app allows you to trigger the photo capture feature using loud sounds and even set reminders that notify you when you are supposed to take a new photo. However, if you want to import photos from your device, record voiceovers or transfer footage via WiFi you must make in-app purchases.</p>
<h3 id="10-iStopMotion-3"><a href="#10-iStopMotion-3" class="headerlink" title="10. iStopMotion"></a>10. iStopMotion</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong>  $9.99</p>

<p><strong>User Ratings:</strong>  3.7</p>
<p>This app offers only a standard set of stop motion tools, such as onion skin or instant playback, which makes it largely overpriced as it fails to offer any of the advanced stop motion photography options. What’s more, you have to install an additional app if you want to snap photos remotely and you won’t have access to any photo editing options. Rearranging the frames you add to the timeline isn’t possible and the app doesn’t even have the undo option. The app offers audio recording features, which enables you to create voiceovers for your videos, and you can import audio files you would like to include in your soundtrack. Even so, iStopMotion is far from being a perfect stop motion app, as there are many better options you can find on App Store.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Recording and editing stop motion animations from Smartphones and tablets has never been easier. Each app for iOS and Android devices we included in this article grants you access to all the tools you’re going to need during the process of making a stop motion animation.

<p>The FCP tool autosaves the changes every 15 minutes. The saved projects are available in the libraries file as a backup for the restore process. You can go to the library folder to view the autosaved projects. The last edited changes can be reflected by tapping the undo option in the Edit menu.</p>
<p>Stepwise instructions to modify the autosave settings in the FCPX program</p>
<p>Step 1: Launch the FCPX app, press Ctrl+Q to open the ‘User Preferences’ window.</p>
<p>Step 2: In the ‘User Preferences’ screen, you can find a wide range of options to modify. Alter the levels of Undo, autosave vault attributes according to your needs, and save the changes. You can witness these parameters in the General section in the User Preference screen.</p>
<p>Use the User Preference window to make necessary changes according to your requirement. BY default, the Autosave Vault is enabled, and you can work on the projects without any hesitation. Additionally, you can modify the attributes like ‘Save a copy for every’, ‘ Keep at most’, and ‘Maximum of’ to personalize your projects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="auto-save"
                ></p>
<p>When the FCP file is open, you need not worry about the saving procedure. The app triggers the autosave mechanism for regular intervals, and the changes will be up-to-date. If you want to store the files manually, then work with its library files. A simple operation like Ctrl+c and Ctrl+v helps you to move the autosaved projects to any storage location. Here are few tips to restore the autosaved FCP files.</p>
<p>Detailed guidelines on the restoration of autosaved files.</p>
<p>Step 1 Open the Final Cut Pro app on your device.</p>
<p>Step 2 Tap the ‘Libraries Sidebar’ to choose the desired library for restore action. Now hit File -&gt; Open Library -&gt; Backup options on the screen.</p>
<p>Step 3 Surf the backup files and choose the desired one that requires a view. Press the Restore from’ option from the pop-up items. Finally, press the ‘Open’ button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="from-backup"
                ></p>
<p>The manual storage option is feasible only after deactivating the autosave mechanism on the FCPX tool. It is not advisable to carry out this activity. The autosave option keeps your works up-to-date, and you will not miss the recent changes at any cost. You can still disable the autosave option to try the manual storage process.</p>
<p>In the FCPX app, press ‘File -&gt; Library Properties’, then from the displayed items, select the ‘Modify Settings’ option beside the ‘Storage Location’ label. Now, in the backups option select ‘Do not Save’ to deactivate the autosave mechanism.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/modify-storage-location.jpg"
                      alt="modify-storage-location"
                ></p>
<p>After completing this procedure, save the changes and get back to the working timeline of</p>
<p>FCPX to continue with your projects. When you edit any projects use the save option without fail else the changes made will be lost in no time.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-save-FCPX-projects-to-desktop-or-external-drives"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-save-FCPX-projects-to-desktop-or-external-drives" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to save FCPX projects to desktop or external drives?"></a><strong>Part 2: How to save FCPX projects to desktop or external drives?</strong></h2><p> Many experts recommend opting for an external storage location to save the FCPX files. It occupies more space, and you need to be careful while selecting the drives to store the library files of the FCPX projects. While saving the files, remove the generated data to optimize the storage process.</p>
<p>First, remove the generated files in the library</p>
<p>Step 1: Tap the Libraries sidebar in the FCPX tool and select ‘Library’ and choose the ’Cache’ option in the property window of Library.</p>
<p>Step 2: Next, press ‘File -&gt; Delete Generated Library Files’. To remove the unnecessary generated files.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="delete-generated-files"
                ></p>
<p>The above action helps to clear up the space occupied by the project. If you want to free up more space, then delete most of the listed generated files.</p>
<p>Secondly, now transfer the FCPX project to external drives.</p>
<p>Step 1 Select the Libraries Sidebar in the FCPX program and choose the desired ‘Library’. Then hit ‘File -&gt; Reveal in Finder. Now, the file opens in the new finder window.</p>
<p>Step 2 Close the FCPX screen and drag the library files from the Finder window to the external hard drive.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="reveal-in-finder"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, you had made it. The FCPX projects were successfully moved on to the external drives quickly. Use the above technique to carry out flawless storage or transfer process.</p>

<p>The FCP tool autosaves the changes every 15 minutes. The saved projects are available in the libraries file as a backup for the restore process. You can go to the library folder to view the autosaved projects. The last edited changes can be reflected by tapping the undo option in the Edit menu.</p>
<p>Stepwise instructions to modify the autosave settings in the FCPX program</p>
<p>Step 1: Launch the FCPX app, press Ctrl+Q to open the ‘User Preferences’ window.</p>
<p>Step 2: In the ‘User Preferences’ screen, you can find a wide range of options to modify. Alter the levels of Undo, autosave vault attributes according to your needs, and save the changes. You can witness these parameters in the General section in the User Preference screen.</p>

                ></p>
<p>When the FCP file is open, you need not worry about the saving procedure. The app triggers the autosave mechanism for regular intervals, and the changes will be up-to-date. If you want to store the files manually, then work with its library files. A simple operation like Ctrl+c and Ctrl+v helps you to move the autosaved projects to any storage location.
