<p>The world is shifting, with more and more businesses and companies using online imagery and video content as a means of reaching their target audience and demographic wherever they may be - and GIF’s represent one of the biggest growing trends of the decade.</p>
<p>But not all GIF’s are perfect. Some react far too quickly, while some are very slow and clunky in their movement – with video editors and animators finding that simply changing the speed of a GIF can have a huge impact on the way it is viewed and used by consumers.</p>

<li>With your gifs open on the screen, right click and select <strong>Speed</strong> <strong>and Duration</strong> .</li>
<li>In the Custom Speed window, you will see a speed slider locates at the middle, which indicates the default 1.x speed. And the Duration option suggests the duration of the gif.</li>
<li>To change the speed of gif, you can drag the speed slider forward or backward to speed up or slow down the playback. Or, you can just enter the number to a specific duration.</li>
<li>With such an easy process for changing the GIF speed, users will find they can adjust the clip to their hearts content, until they achieve the perfect finish.</li>

<h3 id="1-EZGIF-com"><a href="#1-EZGIF-com" class="headerlink" title="1. EZGIF.com"></a>1. EZGIF.com</h3><p>This online GIF speed editor offers all the usability of a basic Windows image or video editing program, but with all the technological expertise of a modern video editor. GIF’s can be edited as GIF’s or as MP4 files, and though the site takes a while to download the completed files, the end result is high in quality and creates a seamless pattern of movement. Other features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>No registration is required and there is no user limit – this really is a free editing site</li>
<li>Colour editing and text overlay can be instantly added to any GIF footage</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-ezgif.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in EZgif"
                ></p>
<p>To change the speed of your GIF using EzGIF, visit this page <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ezgif.com/speed" >https://ezgif.com/speed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Once your GIF is uploaded to the free-to-use site, you can alter the percentage of current speed using a basic drop down – something which should always be altered based on the idea of 100% representing the original speed. Changing the percentage to 200% will make the GIF run 2x faster, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="2-Veed-io"><a href="#2-Veed-io" class="headerlink" title="2. Veed.io"></a>2. Veed.io</h3><p>This site, found at <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer" >https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great way of editing your GIF speed quickly and easily – using just a few basic steps. Once users have arrived on the site and clicked on the big blue ‘Get Started’ button, they will find themselves faced with a very simple upload tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-veed.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in Veed.io"
                ></p>
<p>From there the size, speed and colouring can be altered on their GIF, with the ability to add music also available. Changing the speed can be done using a selection of pre-programmed buttons – ranging from 0.5x (half the original speed) up to 2x (double the original speed). Users can also select the custom speed button and play around with a speed of their own making.</p>
<h3 id="3-Lunapic"><a href="#3-Lunapic" class="headerlink" title="3. Lunapic"></a>3. Lunapic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-lunapic.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in Lunapic"
                ></p>
<p>What we like about Lunapic is the way that the site allows us to change not only the GIF speed but also the order in which different images and visuals are presented – giving the user a chance to upload new content to add into their GIF or else simply adjust the speed and timing delay on the original clip. Users can add animation to certain aspects and parts of the video or image and can set the looping option of their GIF to start and end at any point – altering the way the end consumer views the starting image. The speeds included on the site may be determined in advance giving you a limited choice, but the range available means this isn’t too much of a problem.</p>
<h3 id="4-GifGit"><a href="#4-GifGit" class="headerlink" title="4. GifGit"></a>4. GifGit</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-gifgit.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in GifGit"
                ></p>
<p>Cheesy website names aside, this online tool is super easy to use with a very basic user interface. Found through this site - <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit" >https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - editing GIF’s is a simple case of uploading the GIF clip and using the Delay tool as a way of setting the speed using the delay of milliseconds on each frame. This number, in the example sitting at 80, refers to the number of milliseconds that will be spent on each frame of the GIF – with a lower number enabling the GIF to move faster while a larger delay number will make your GIF play much slower.</p>
<p>This site is good if you’re happy to experiment with a little trial and error!</p>
<h3 id="5-IMG-Flip"><a href="#5-IMG-Flip" class="headerlink" title="5. IMG Flip"></a>5. IMG Flip</h3><p>As with many online tools, this site does come with limitations – however, in our opinion the vast range of customisable options and editing features outweigh the fact that your GIF’s can only be stored up to 4MB before you have to start paying. For the most part, this is a site which is ideal for those who are simply looking to edit one or two GIF’s – if you’re looking to make a habit of it, then you would be best looking at one of the other sites which offers more in terms of storage and free uses.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-img-flip.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in  IMG Flip"
                ></p>
<p>Get familiar with IMG Flip through this link - <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgflip.com/gif-maker" >https://imgflip.com/gif-maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - and spend some time working through the different options available. To change the speed you simply need upload your clip and then adjust the speed as a percentage of the original clip – 100% being the starting point, with 200% running the GIF at twice the speed and 50% running it at half speed.</p>

Our phones are what we have with us at all times, and so it follows that any kind of editing we hope to do should be achievable using these portable devices – after all, modern smartphones are now fitted with cameras which surpass the capability of even some of the most expensive cameras on the market. So, which are the best GIF speed changers for phones?</p>

                ></p>
<p>We start with a simple one which can be found on the app store using any search for a GIF app. This particular app plays on the concept of building your own memes, giving users a chance to enhance their own comic value on platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook using their own images or multiple GIF’s strung together. We particularly love the fact that ImgPlay’s platform allows users to add their own text and emojis over the top of the visuals, completely personalising the end product and creating something which is unique for their own use. A simple slider tool allows for easy editing of the GIF speed, presenting an all-round great tool for beginners and experience GIF makers alike.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Imgur app is one of the most popular GIF creation tools out there – offering users with a platform which allows them edit as many GIFs as they like, play with the speed of existing and new GIFs, and share their creations with other users who can share your designs and help you go viral. As much an online community as a GIF editing tool, Imgur could well be the new Instagram – if Instagram suddenly decided to wave goodbye to the influencers and adverts and make way for user built content and humorous motion videos instead!</p>

                ></p>
<p>This is a tool which supports the creation of GIFs using actions and movements which you capture on camera straight into the app. Opening the app, you simply select the camera feature and capture the movement or motion – before diving into the editing of speed, colour, appearance and overlays. A great tool which is instant to use and allows you to create funny and more serious GIFs depending on the movement you capture.</p>

<p>This platform is designed to allow users to edit and add to existing GIFs which they may want to adjust, add filters to and overlay with music. As with many of the other portable device tools created for Android and iPhone, the main features of this app are its user friendly interface and the fact that all GIFs created can be downloaded directly to the phone or uploaded straight to social media – depending on how the user intends to use their GIF.</p>

<p>One of the fastest tools both to understand and to use, GIF studio really lets you feel like you are in a proper video editing studio – even when using the limited screen size of your phone. Users can edit the speed on existing GIFs or can create new collages with multiple GIFs, benefitting from added animation and colour and visual effects without losing the quality of the original imagery or footage.</p>
<h4 id="GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ"><a href="#GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ" class="headerlink" title="GIF Speed Changer FAQ"></a>GIF Speed Changer FAQ</h4><p><strong>Can I slow down a GIF?</strong></p>
<p>In short, yes. How you do this will depend on the platform you use, however for the most part, any platform which allows the GIF to be sped up will also allow you to slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>How do you change the speed of a GIF in PowerPoint?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no tool within PowerPoint that allows users to adjust the speed of an external GIF. The small animations and movements of images and words created and controlled within PowerPoint can be adjusted in the settings of each animation tool – however, at present, GIFs themselves are unable to be altered in PowerPoint itself.</p>
<p><strong>How do you make a GIF 30fps?</strong></p>
<p>This number refers to the frame control time, with most computer displays running at around 60fps. To adjust this number to 30fps, the user will need to enter the settings of the GIF and set the run time at 30 for a delay of 0.03 seconds on each frame.</p>
<p><strong>Why is frame rate important in GIF animation and how do you change frame rate in GIF exportation?</strong></p>
<p>Frame rate comes into play when watching back the GIF as a piece of complete footage – with frame rate affecting the overall smooth transition of the GIF from frame to frame and back to the beginning. If your frame rate isn’t controlled, the finish will be jumpy and won’t look good. When you move to convert and export your GIF, you will have an option to adjust the loop setting and timeline setting – as well as the frames per second. Setting this at 30 will provide you with a seamless and consistently high quality finish – perfect for your brand new GIF.</p>

<p>But not all GIF’s are perfect. Some react far too quickly, while some are very slow and clunky in their movement – with video editors and animators finding that simply changing the speed of a GIF can have a huge impact on the way it is viewed and used by consumers.</p>

<h3 id="1-EZGIF-com-1"><a href="#1-EZGIF-com-1" class="headerlink" title="1. EZGIF.com"></a>1. EZGIF.com</h3><p>This online GIF speed editor offers all the usability of a basic Windows image or video editing program, but with all the technological expertise of a modern video editor. GIF’s can be edited as GIF’s or as MP4 files, and though the site takes a while to download the completed files, the end result is high in quality and creates a seamless pattern of movement. Other features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>No registration is required and there is no user limit – this really is a free editing site</li>
<li>Colour editing and text overlay can be instantly added to any GIF footage</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-ezgif.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in EZgif"
                ></p>
<p>To change the speed of your GIF using EzGIF, visit this page <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ezgif.com/speed" >https://ezgif.com/speed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Once your GIF is uploaded to the free-to-use site, you can alter the percentage of current speed using a basic drop down – something which should always be altered based on the idea of 100% representing the original speed. Changing the percentage to 200% will make the GIF run 2x faster, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="2-Veed-io-1"><a href="#2-Veed-io-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Veed.io"></a>2. Veed.io</h3><p>This site, found at <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer" >https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great way of editing your GIF speed quickly and easily – using just a few basic steps. Once users have arrived on the site and clicked on the big blue ‘Get Started’ button, they will find themselves faced with a very simple upload tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-veed.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in Veed.io"
                ></p>
<p>From there the size, speed and colouring can be altered on their GIF, with the ability to add music also available. Changing the speed can be done using a selection of pre-programmed buttons – ranging from 0.5x (half the original speed) up to 2x (double the original speed). Users can also select the custom speed button and play around with a speed of their own making.</p>
<h3 id="3-Lunapic-1"><a href="#3-Lunapic-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Lunapic"></a>3. Lunapic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="change gif speed in Lunapic"
                ></p>
<p>What we like about Lunapic is the way that the site allows us to change not only the GIF speed but also the order in which different images and visuals are presented – giving the user a chance to upload new content to add into their GIF or else simply adjust the speed and timing delay on the original clip. Users can add animation to certain aspects and parts of the video or image and can set the looping option of their GIF to start and end at any point – altering the way the end consumer views the starting image. The speeds included on the site may be determined in advance giving you a limited choice, but the range available means this isn’t too much of a problem.</p>
<h3 id="4-GifGit-1"><a href="#4-GifGit-1" class="headerlink" title="4. GifGit"></a>4. GifGit</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="change gif speed in GifGit"
                ></p>
<p>Cheesy website names aside, this online tool is super easy to use with a very basic user interface. Found through this site - <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit" >https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - editing GIF’s is a simple case of uploading the GIF clip and using the Delay tool as a way of setting the speed using the delay of milliseconds on each frame. This number, in the example sitting at 80, refers to the number of milliseconds that will be spent on each frame of the GIF – with a lower number enabling the GIF to move faster while a larger delay number will make your GIF play much slower.</p>
<p>This site is good if you’re happy to experiment with a little trial and error!</p>
<h3 id="5-IMG-Flip-1"><a href="#5-IMG-Flip-1" class="headerlink" title="5. IMG Flip"></a>5. IMG Flip</h3><p>As with many online tools, this site does come with limitations – however, in our opinion the vast range of customisable options and editing features outweigh the fact that your GIF’s can only be stored up to 4MB before you have to start paying. For the most part, this is a site which is ideal for those who are simply looking to edit one or two GIF’s – if you’re looking to make a habit of it, then you would be best looking at one of the other sites which offers more in terms of storage and free uses.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

To change the speed you simply need upload your clip and then adjust the speed as a percentage of the original clip – 100% being the starting point, with 200% running the GIF at twice the speed and 50% running it at half speed.</p>

Our phones are what we have with us at all times, and so it follows that any kind of editing we hope to do should be achievable using these portable devices – after all, modern smartphones are now fitted with cameras which surpass the capability of even some of the most expensive cameras on the market. So, which are the best GIF speed changers for phones?</p>

                ></p>
<p>We start with a simple one which can be found on the app store using any search for a GIF app. This particular app plays on the concept of building your own memes, giving users a chance to enhance their own comic value on platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook using their own images or multiple GIF’s strung together. We particularly love the fact that ImgPlay’s platform allows users to add their own text and emojis over the top of the visuals, completely personalising the end product and creating something which is unique for their own use. A simple slider tool allows for easy editing of the GIF speed, presenting an all-round great tool for beginners and experience GIF makers alike.</p>

<p>The Imgur app is one of the most popular GIF creation tools out there – offering users with a platform which allows them edit as many GIFs as they like, play with the speed of existing and new GIFs, and share their creations with other users who can share your designs and help you go viral. As much an online community as a GIF editing tool, Imgur could well be the new Instagram – if Instagram suddenly decided to wave goodbye to the influencers and adverts and make way for user built content and humorous motion videos instead!</p>

<p>This is a tool which supports the creation of GIFs using actions and movements which you capture on camera straight into the app. Opening the app, you simply select the camera feature and capture the movement or motion – before diving into the editing of speed, colour, appearance and overlays. A great tool which is instant to use and allows you to create funny and more serious GIFs depending on the movement you capture.</p>

<p>This platform is designed to allow users to edit and add to existing GIFs which they may want to adjust, add filters to and overlay with music. As with many of the other portable device tools created for Android and iPhone, the main features of this app are its user friendly interface and the fact that all GIFs created can be downloaded directly to the phone or uploaded straight to social media – depending on how the user intends to use their GIF.</p>

<p>One of the fastest tools both to understand and to use, GIF studio really lets you feel like you are in a proper video editing studio – even when using the limited screen size of your phone. Users can edit the speed on existing GIFs or can create new collages with multiple GIFs, benefitting from added animation and colour and visual effects without losing the quality of the original imagery or footage.</p>
<h4 id="GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ-1"><a href="#GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ-1" class="headerlink" title="GIF Speed Changer FAQ"></a>GIF Speed Changer FAQ</h4><p><strong>Can I slow down a GIF?</strong></p>
<p>In short, yes. How you do this will depend on the platform you use, however for the most part, any platform which allows the GIF to be sped up will also allow you to slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>How do you change the speed of a GIF in PowerPoint?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no tool within PowerPoint that allows users to adjust the speed of an external GIF. The small animations and movements of images and words created and controlled within PowerPoint can be adjusted in the settings of each animation tool – however, at present, GIFs themselves are unable to be altered in PowerPoint itself.</p>
<p><strong>How do you make a GIF 30fps?</strong></p>
<p>This number refers to the frame control time, with most computer displays running at around 60fps. To adjust this number to 30fps, the user will need to enter the settings of the GIF and set the run time at 30 for a delay of 0.03 seconds on each frame.</p>
<p><strong>Why is frame rate important in GIF animation and how do you change frame rate in GIF exportation?</strong></p>
<p>Frame rate comes into play when watching back the GIF as a piece of complete footage – with frame rate affecting the overall smooth transition of the GIF from frame to frame and back to the beginning. If your frame rate isn’t controlled, the finish will be jumpy and won’t look good. When you move to convert and export your GIF, you will have an option to adjust the loop setting and timeline setting – as well as the frames per second. Setting this at 30 will provide you with a seamless and consistently high quality finish – perfect for your brand new GIF.</p>

Users can add animation to certain aspects and parts of the video or image and can set the looping option of their GIF to start and end at any point – altering the way the end consumer views the starting image. The speeds included on the site may be determined in advance giving you a limited choice, but the range available means this isn’t too much of a problem.</p>

We particularly love the fact that ImgPlay’s platform allows users to add their own text and emojis over the top of the visuals, completely personalising the end product and creating something which is unique for their own use. A simple slider tool allows for easy editing of the GIF speed, presenting an all-round great tool for beginners and experience GIF makers alike.</p>

<h4 id="GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ-2"><a href="#GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ-2" class="headerlink" title="GIF Speed Changer FAQ"></a>GIF Speed Changer FAQ</h4><p><strong>Can I slow down a GIF?</strong></p>
<p>In short, yes. How you do this will depend on the platform you use, however for the most part, any platform which allows the GIF to be sped up will also allow you to slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>How do you change the speed of a GIF in PowerPoint?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no tool within PowerPoint that allows users to adjust the speed of an external GIF. The small animations and movements of images and words created and controlled within PowerPoint can be adjusted in the settings of each animation tool – however, at present, GIFs themselves are unable to be altered in PowerPoint itself.</p>
<p><strong>How do you make a GIF 30fps?</strong></p>
<p>This number refers to the frame control time, with most computer displays running at around 60fps. To adjust this number to 30fps, the user will need to enter the settings of the GIF and set the run time at 30 for a delay of 0.03 seconds on each frame.</p>
<p><strong>Why is frame rate important in GIF animation and how do you change frame rate in GIF exportation?</strong></p>
<p>Frame rate comes into play when watching back the GIF as a piece of complete footage – with frame rate affecting the overall smooth transition of the GIF from frame to frame and back to the beginning. If your frame rate isn’t controlled, the finish will be jumpy and won’t look good. When you move to convert and export your GIF, you will have an option to adjust the loop setting and timeline setting – as well as the frames per second. Setting this at 30 will provide you with a seamless and consistently high quality finish – perfect for your brand new GIF.</p>

<p>The world is shifting, with more and more businesses and companies using online imagery and video content as a means of reaching their target audience and demographic wherever they may be - and GIF’s represent one of the biggest growing trends of the decade.</p>
<p>But not all GIF’s are perfect. Some react far too quickly, while some are very slow and clunky in their movement – with video editors and animators finding that simply changing the speed of a GIF can have a huge impact on the way it is viewed and used by consumers.</p>

As much an online community as a GIF editing tool, Imgur could well be the new Instagram – if Instagram suddenly decided to wave goodbye to the influencers and adverts and make way for user built content and humorous motion videos instead!</p>

<h4 id="GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ-3"><a href="#GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ-3" class="headerlink" title="GIF Speed Changer FAQ"></a>GIF Speed Changer FAQ</h4><p><strong>Can I slow down a GIF?</strong></p>
<p>In short, yes. How you do this will depend on the platform you use, however for the most part, any platform which allows the GIF to be sped up will also allow you to slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>How do you change the speed of a GIF in PowerPoint?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no tool within PowerPoint that allows users to adjust the speed of an external GIF. The small animations and movements of images and words created and controlled within PowerPoint can be adjusted in the settings of each animation tool – however, at present, GIFs themselves are unable to be altered in PowerPoint itself.</p>
<p><strong>How do you make a GIF 30fps?</strong></p>
<p>This number refers to the frame control time, with most computer displays running at around 60fps. To adjust this number to 30fps, the user will need to enter the settings of the GIF and set the run time at 30 for a delay of 0.03 seconds on each frame.</p>
<p><strong>Why is frame rate important in GIF animation and how do you change frame rate in GIF exportation?</strong></p>
<p>Frame rate comes into play when watching back the GIF as a piece of complete footage – with frame rate affecting the overall smooth transition of the GIF from frame to frame and back to the beginning. If your frame rate isn’t controlled, the finish will be jumpy and won’t look good. When you move to convert and export your GIF, you will have an option to adjust the loop setting and timeline setting – as well as the frames per second. Setting this at 30 will provide you with a seamless and consistently high quality finish – perfect for your brand new GIF.</p>

<p>Besides the promotional purposes, you can also use trailers to create entertaining short videos in order to have fun with your friends. Fortunately, you don’t need a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> suite to perform this task since there are hundreds of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that allow you <strong>to create trailers on iPhones and iPads.</strong></p>

In addition, the music you choose as the soundtrack for your trailer needs to match with the visuals and the editing style you opted for. Let’s take a look at the top 10 movie trailer apps for iPhones and iPads.</p>
<h3 id="1-iMovie"><a href="#1-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="1. iMovie"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p>All iPhones and iPads offer a free way to edit all videos you record with them. All you need to do is make sure that iMovie is installed on your iPhone or iPad and you can start editing the footage you recorded. In addition, you can also import videos recorded with different types of cameras into iMovie, as long as they are saved in the file format that is compatible with this app.</p>
<p>iMovie offers a variety of predesigned trailer themes, so you just have to pick the one you like the most and then choose the footage you want to include in your trailer. Keep in mind that you cannot add music to any of the trailer themes, but you can export the trailer you created and create the soundtrack from iMovie’s Video mode. What’s more, you can also use this app to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add transitions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, visual effects or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >titles <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the trailers you create with iMovie.</p>

The app lets you choose from hundreds of HD templates that can be customized quickly to meet the demands of your project. Moreover, you can create your own templates and use them on all future projects.

<p>The trailers you create with the free version of Intro.Maker + 3D Movie Trailer are going to be watermarked and you must make an in-app purchase in order to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >remove the watermark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

<p>Making a trailer or an intro for the videos you share online shouldn’t take too much of your time. This iPhone app offers an easy solution to all vloggers and video content creators who want to create trailers for their film projects from their phones. There are more than a thousand customizable templates to choose from, as well as over 700 motion stickers. In addition, the app doesn’t limit the number of titles you can add to a single project, and it lets you adjust the size, shadow and stroke values for each title you include in a video.</p>
<p>Even though the app doesn’t have a library of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free songs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can still use it to create soundtracks or even record voiceovers for your trailers. Moreover, the app’s file-sharing capabilities are underwhelming since you can only export videos to the camera roll. Purchasing the Intro Maker Premium or Premium Life Time subscription plans can be a good idea if you want to create new trailers and intros frequently.</p>

Let’s take a look at the top 10 movie trailer apps for iPhones and iPads.</p>
<h3 id="1-iMovie-3"><a href="#1-iMovie-3" class="headerlink" title="1. iMovie"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p>All iPhones and iPads offer a free way to edit all videos you record with them. All you need to do is make sure that iMovie is installed on your iPhone or iPad and you can start editing the footage you recorded. In addition, you can also import videos recorded with different types of cameras into iMovie, as long as they are saved in the file format that is compatible with this app.</p>
<p>iMovie offers a variety of predesigned trailer themes, so you just have to pick the one you like the most and then choose the footage you want to include in your trailer. Keep in mind that you cannot add music to any of the trailer themes, but you can export the trailer you created and create the soundtrack from iMovie’s Video mode. What’s more, you can also use this app to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add transitions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, visual effects or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >titles <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the trailers you create with iMovie.</p>

There are more than a thousand customizable templates to choose from, as well as over 700 motion stickers.

<p>With this guide of the best five <strong>aspect ratio calculators online</strong> we’ve put together for you, you cannot go wrong!</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Part-1-Typical-Aspect-Ratios-and-Sizes-of-Screens-and-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Part-1-Typical-Aspect-Ratios-and-Sizes-of-Screens-and-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Part 1: Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos"></a>Part 1 Part 1: Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos</h2><p>An aspect ratio is a measurement representing the ratio between the width and height of a screen or a video. It determines the length of your video or screen. Not only screens and videos, but you can use the concept also in images.</p>
<p>And, it is written as ‘x:y’ where ‘x’ is the width and ‘y’ is the height.</p>
<p>There isn’t any one-size-fits-all when we need to use the video aspect ratios. Aspect ratios are generally selected based on where the video will post, how it will be visible, and what aim it usually serves.</p>
<p>Videos utilized for social media will vary from trailers shows or movies shown in theaters. There are common aspect ratios for modern televisions, but broadcasters can consider using the aspect ratio that operates great with their audience and content.</p>
<p>Since most videos showcase through standard online video platforms, custom aspect ratios are not commonly used.</p>
<p>Here are a few standard aspect ratios that you can use for live streaming and other video creation:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-2.jpg"
                      alt="aspect ratios"
                ></p>
<p><strong>16:9</strong></p>
<p>A 16:9 aspect ratio represents a wide rectangle. It is also called “1.71:1,” the most accessible form of the ratio, mathematically speaking.</p>
<p>This ratio is mainly used in video creation and streaming and is considered the international standard format for cinema and television.</p>
<p>Many also tend to use this highly famous aspect ratio on their sites.</p>
<p>It is also more cost-effective to use screens compatible with this ratio instead of their predecessors. The standardization of computer monitors and televisions saved producers both the money and time spent in the research field.</p>
<p>One of the ideal resolutions you can use with a 16:9 aspect ratio is 4Kor 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels.</p>
<p><strong>1:1</strong></p>
<p>The 1:1 video aspect ratio is one of the ideal squares used with square television sets.</p>
<p>It is much less in demand but usually visible on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.</p>
<p>Many cameras still have a square setting even though it’s not the most commonly used aspect ratio.</p>
<p><strong>4:3</strong></p>
<p>The 4:3 aspect ratio was the general screen size for computer monitors and televisions before 16:9 and 16:10. The reason for the switch was the HDTV birth. It’s because the 16:9 and 16:10 aspect ratios allow for better resolutions than 4:3 do.</p>
<p>This aspect ratio was still considered for Apple iPads until they released the 2018 iPad Pro.</p>
<p><strong>3:2</strong></p>
<p>The 3:2 aspect ratio was primarily seen in classic 35 mm still photography still used on tablets, laptops, and various game consoles in the handheld form.</p>

It determines the length of your video or screen. Not only screens and videos, but you can use the concept also in images.</p>
<p>And, it is written as ‘x:y’ where ‘x’ is the width and ‘y’ is the height.</p>
<p>There isn’t any one-size-fits-all when we need to use the video aspect ratios. Aspect ratios are generally selected based on where the video will post, how it will be visible, and what aim it usually serves.</p>
<p>Videos utilized for social media will vary from trailers shows or movies shown in theaters. There are common aspect ratios for modern televisions, but broadcasters can consider using the aspect ratio that operates great with their audience and content.</p>
<p>Since most videos showcase through standard online video platforms, custom aspect ratios are not commonly used.</p>
<p>Here are a few standard aspect ratios that you can use for live streaming and other video creation:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="aspect ratios"
                ></p>
<p><strong>16:9</strong></p>
<p>A 16:9 aspect ratio represents a wide rectangle. It is also called “1.71:1,” the most accessible form of the ratio, mathematically speaking.</p>
<p>This ratio is mainly used in video creation and streaming and is considered the international standard format for cinema and television.</p>
<p>Many also tend to use this highly famous aspect ratio on their sites.</p>
<p>It is also more cost-effective to use screens compatible with this ratio instead of their predecessors. The standardization of computer monitors and televisions saved producers both the money and time spent in the research field.</p>
<p>One of the ideal resolutions you can use with a 16:9 aspect ratio is 4Kor 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels.</p>
<p><strong>1:1</strong></p>
<p>The 1:1 video aspect ratio is one of the ideal squares used with square television sets.</p>
<p>It is much less in demand but usually visible on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.</p>
<p>Many cameras still have a square setting even though it’s not the most commonly used aspect ratio.</p>
<p><strong>4:3</strong></p>
<p>The 4:3 aspect ratio was the general screen size for computer monitors and televisions before 16:9 and 16:10. The reason for the switch was the HDTV birth. It’s because the 16:9 and 16:10 aspect ratios allow for better resolutions than 4:3 do.</p>
<p>This aspect ratio was still considered for Apple iPads until they released the 2018 iPad Pro.</p>
<p><strong>3:2</strong></p>
<p>The 3:2 aspect ratio was primarily seen in classic 35 mm still photography still used on tablets, laptops, and various game consoles in the handheld form.</p>
<p>Many micro- to medium-sized cameras still use the 3:2 aspect ratio settings, but broadcasters rarely use it today.</p>
<p><strong>21:9</strong></p>
<p>The 21:9 aspect ratios have a pretty specific purpose. It is often called cinematic widescreen or ultra-widescreen.</p>
<p>It is also helpful for films with an anamorphic format. Anamorphic format videos create an optical illusion that offers a 360-degree view.</p>
<p>You are likely to look for the videos with this aspect ratio in notable museums, theme parks, theaters, and the like.</p>
<p><strong>9:16</strong></p>
<p>A 9:16 aspect ratio is for tall videos. This aspect ratio became famous after the launch of smartphones with video capabilities.</p>
<p>For instance, the optimal measure for an Instagram story is 1080 px by 1920 px, and thus its ratio comes out as 9:16. The same goes for other famous apps with “story” features, including Snapchat and Facebook.</p>
<p>This makes sense because the iPhone camera’s video setting can record footage in both 16:9 and 9:16.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Part-1-Typical-Aspect-Ratios-and-Sizes-of-Screens-and-Videos-2"><a href="#Part-1-Part-1-Typical-Aspect-Ratios-and-Sizes-of-Screens-and-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Part 1: Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos"></a>Part 1 Part 1: Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos</h2><p>An aspect ratio is a measurement representing the ratio between the width and height of a screen or a video. It determines the length of your video or screen. Not only screens and videos, but you can use the concept also in images.</p>
<p>And, it is written as ‘x:y’ where ‘x’ is the width and ‘y’ is the height.</p>
<p>There isn’t any one-size-fits-all when we need to use the video aspect ratios. Aspect ratios are generally selected based on where the video will post, how it will be visible, and what aim it usually serves.</p>
<p>Videos utilized for social media will vary from trailers shows or movies shown in theaters. There are common aspect ratios for modern televisions, but broadcasters can consider using the aspect ratio that operates great with their audience and content.</p>
<p>Since most videos showcase through standard online video platforms, custom aspect ratios are not commonly used.</p>
<p>Here are a few standard aspect ratios that you can use for live streaming and other video creation:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-2.jpg"
                      alt="aspect ratios"
                ></p>
<p><strong>16:9</strong></p>
<p>A 16:9 aspect ratio represents a wide rectangle. It is also called “1.71:1,” the most accessible form of the ratio, mathematically speaking.</p>
<p>This ratio is mainly used in video creation and streaming and is considered the international standard format for cinema and television.</p>
<p>Many also tend to use this highly famous aspect ratio on their sites.</p>
<p>It is also more cost-effective to use screens compatible with this ratio instead of their predecessors. The standardization of computer monitors and televisions saved producers both the money and time spent in the research field.</p>
<p>One of the ideal resolutions you can use with a 16:9 aspect ratio is 4Kor 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels.</p>
<p><strong>1:1</strong></p>
<p>The 1:1 video aspect ratio is one of the ideal squares used with square television sets.</p>
<p>It is much less in demand but usually visible on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.</p>
<p>Many cameras still have a square setting even though it’s not the most commonly used aspect ratio.</p>
<p><strong>4:3</strong></p>
<p>The 4:3 aspect ratio was the general screen size for computer monitors and televisions before 16:9 and 16:10. The reason for the switch was the HDTV birth. It’s because the 16:9 and 16:10 aspect ratios allow for better resolutions than 4:3 do.</p>
<p>This aspect ratio was still considered for Apple iPads until they released the 2018 iPad Pro.</p>
<p><strong>3:2</strong></p>
<p>The 3:2 aspect ratio was primarily seen in classic 35 mm still photography still used on tablets, laptops, and various game consoles in the handheld form.</p>
<p>Many micro- to medium-sized cameras still use the 3:2 aspect ratio settings, but broadcasters rarely use it today.</p>
<p><strong>21:9</strong></p>
<p>The 21:9 aspect ratios have a pretty specific purpose. It is often called cinematic widescreen or ultra-widescreen.</p>
<p>It is also helpful for films with an anamorphic format. Anamorphic format videos create an optical illusion that offers a 360-degree view.</p>
<p>You are likely to look for the videos with this aspect ratio in notable museums, theme parks, theaters, and the like.</p>
<p><strong>9:16</strong></p>
<p>A 9:16 aspect ratio is for tall videos. This aspect ratio became famous after the launch of smartphones with video capabilities.</p>
<p>For instance, the optimal measure for an Instagram story is 1080 px by 1920 px, and thus its ratio comes out as 9:16. The same goes for other famous apps with “story” features, including Snapchat and Facebook.</p>
<p>This makes sense because the iPhone camera’s video setting can record footage in both 16:9 and 9:16.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Most cameras with video capabilities are available with various aspect ratio settings. This helps you decide which aspect ratio you’d like your video to have before recording it.</p>
<p>If you are looking to determine the aspect ratio of a video already shot, you can easily access additional information for the file.</p>
<p>The information button is a small “i” in a circle on Mac. Move on to right-click a file and select “<strong>Properties</strong>“ on your PC.</p>
<p>It may give you the actual width and height of the video, but you can divide the two to find the aspect ratio.</p>
<p>However, you don’t need to hassle as we’ll enlist the best five <strong>aspect ratio</strong> <strong>calculators online</strong> below.</p>

<p>With this guide of the best five <strong>aspect ratio calculators online</strong> we’ve put together for you, you cannot go wrong!</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Part-1-Typical-Aspect-Ratios-and-Sizes-of-Screens-and-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-1-Part-1-Typical-Aspect-Ratios-and-Sizes-of-Screens-and-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Part 1: Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos"></a>Part 1 Part 1: Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos</h2><p>An aspect ratio is a measurement representing the ratio between the width and height of a screen or a video. It determines the length of your video or screen. Not only screens and videos, but you can use the concept also in images.</p>
<p>And, it is written as ‘x:y’ where ‘x’ is the width and ‘y’ is the height.</p>
<p>There isn’t any one-size-fits-all when we need to use the video aspect ratios. Aspect ratios are generally selected based on where the video will post, how it will be visible, and what aim it usually serves.</p>
<p>Videos utilized for social media will vary from trailers shows or movies shown in theaters. There are common aspect ratios for modern televisions, but broadcasters can consider using the aspect ratio that operates great with their audience and content.</p>
<p>Since most videos showcase through standard online video platforms, custom aspect ratios are not commonly used.</p>
<p>Here are a few standard aspect ratios that you can use for live streaming and other video creation:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-2.jpg"
                      alt="aspect ratios"
                ></p>
<p><strong>16:9</strong></p>
<p>A 16:9 aspect ratio represents a wide rectangle. It is also called “1.71:1,” the most accessible form of the ratio, mathematically speaking.</p>
<p>This ratio is mainly used in video creation and streaming and is considered the international standard format for cinema and television.</p>
<p>Many also tend to use this highly famous aspect ratio on their sites.</p>
<p>It is also more cost-effective to use screens compatible with this ratio instead of their predecessors. The standardization of computer monitors and televisions saved producers both the money and time spent in the research field.</p>
<p>One of the ideal resolutions you can use with a 16:9 aspect ratio is 4Kor 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels.</p>
<p><strong>1:1</strong></p>
<p>The 1:1 video aspect ratio is one of the ideal squares used with square television sets.</p>
<p>It is much less in demand but usually visible on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.</p>
<p>Many cameras still have a square setting even though it’s not the most commonly used aspect ratio.</p>
<p><strong>4:3</strong></p>
<p>The 4:3 aspect ratio was the general screen size for computer monitors and televisions before 16:9 and 16:10. The reason for the switch was the HDTV birth. It’s because the 16:9 and 16:10 aspect ratios allow for better resolutions than 4:3 do.</p>
<p>This aspect ratio was still considered for Apple iPads until they released the 2018 iPad Pro.</p>
<p><strong>3:2</strong></p>
<p>The 3:2 aspect ratio was primarily seen in classic 35 mm still photography still used on tablets, laptops, and various game consoles in the handheld form.</p>
<p>Many micro- to medium-sized cameras still use the 3:2 aspect ratio settings, but broadcasters rarely use it today.</p>
<p><strong>21:9</strong></p>
<p>The 21:9 aspect ratios have a pretty specific purpose. It is often called cinematic widescreen or ultra-widescreen.</p>
<p>It is also helpful for films with an anamorphic format. Anamorphic format videos create an optical illusion that offers a 360-degree view.</p>
<p>You are likely to look for the videos with this aspect ratio in notable museums, theme parks, theaters, and the like.</p>
<p><strong>9:16</strong></p>
<p>A 9:16 aspect ratio is for tall videos. This aspect ratio became famous after the launch of smartphones with video capabilities.</p>
<p>For instance, the optimal measure for an Instagram story is 1080 px by 1920 px, and thus its ratio comes out as 9:16. The same goes for other famous apps with “story” features, including Snapchat and Facebook.</p>
<p>This makes sense because the iPhone camera’s video setting can record footage in both 16:9 and 9:16.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-Know-the-Aspect-Ratio-of-My-Video-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-Know-the-Aspect-Ratio-of-My-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do I Know the Aspect Ratio of My Video?"></a>Part 2 How Do I Know the Aspect Ratio of My Video?</h2><p><img

                      alt="aspect ratios"
                ></p>
<p>Most cameras with video capabilities are available with various aspect ratio settings. This helps you decide which aspect ratio you’d like your video to have before recording it.</p>
<p>If you are looking to determine the aspect ratio of a video already shot, you can easily access additional information for the file.</p>
<p>The information button is a small “i” in a circle on Mac. Move on to right-click a file and select “<strong>Properties</strong>“ on your PC.</p>
<p>It may give you the actual width and height of the video, but you can divide the two to find the aspect ratio.</p>
<p>However, you don’t need to hassle as we’ll enlist the best five <strong>aspect ratio</strong> <strong>calculators online</strong> below.</p>
<h3 id="01Calculate-Aspect-Ratio-3"><a href="#01Calculate-Aspect-Ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="01Calculate Aspect Ratio"></a>01Calculate Aspect Ratio</h3><p><img
