<p>It has already been five years since Steller was named as one of the best apps on the App Store by Apple, but very little has changed in the meantime. You don’t have to be a professional storyteller in order to create engaging visual stories with this app since you can select a theme you like and let Steller do all the heavy lifting for you. There just ten text styles to choose from and the app doesn’t offer even the basic video editing tools, which limits your options throughout the video editing process. Nonetheless, you can share all video content you edit with Steller directly to your Instagram Stories.</p>

<p>Creating Facebook or Instagram Stories that attract the attention of thousands of daily viewers is what Unfold does best. You can apply ten different filters and effects to all videos you record with this app and then choose from over 150 video templates. Unfold also grants you access to advanced text tools that enable you to customize the messages you want to distribute through social media channels. The free version of Unfold offers only a limited range of options, and you must upgrade to Unfold+ if you want to access all of the themes, fonts, and stickers this app provides. Despite the great user rating, Unfold still lacks video and audio editing tools that would allow its users to manipulate their footage without any restrictions.</p>

<p>iPhone owners in need of a video editing app that allows them to record and edit their footage with professional tools should consider installing 24 FPS. In addition to excellent video recording capabilities, this app features a plethora of options you can use to enhance the colors in the videos you edit. Importing LUTs into 24 FPS is a routine operation that can reduce the amount of time you have to spend on giving a video a particular cinematic style. Skin-thinning and skin smoothing filters enable you to beautify the people in your videos and make them more visually appealing to the online audience. The app’s video editor also contains audio editing options that make creating a video’s soundtrack fun and enjoyable.</p>

<p>Recording and editing social media videos from your iPhone enables you to produce visually impressive content wherever you are. An app like Vue is a perfect option if you don’t want to post unedited footage on your social media accounts, but don’t have the time to use a professional video editing software. Besides offering more than twenty filters, Vue also lets you change a video’s playback speed, merge or split multiple clips and enhance the colors of each clip you edit. The seemingly endless library of royalty-free songs offers you all the resources you are going to need while creating a soundtrack for your video, and you can also control the volume of video’s original sound and audio files you added to a project.</p>

<p>It has already been five years since Steller was named as one of the best apps on the App Store by Apple, but very little has changed in the meantime. You don’t have to be a professional storyteller in order to create engaging visual stories with this app since you can select a theme you like and let Steller do all the heavy lifting for you. There just ten text styles to choose from and the app doesn’t offer even the basic video editing tools, which limits your options throughout the video editing process. Nonetheless, you can share all video content you edit with Steller directly to your Instagram Stories.</p>

<p>Creating Facebook or Instagram Stories that attract the attention of thousands of daily viewers is what Unfold does best. You can apply ten different filters and effects to all videos you record with this app and then choose from over 150 video templates. Unfold also grants you access to advanced text tools that enable you to customize the messages you want to distribute through social media channels. The free version of Unfold offers only a limited range of options, and you must upgrade to Unfold+ if you want to access all of the themes, fonts, and stickers this app provides. Despite the great user rating, Unfold still lacks video and audio editing tools that would allow its users to manipulate their footage without any restrictions.</p>

<p>Apple included the Spark Camera app in their selection of the best storytelling apps in 2024, and a brief look at the app’s features shows why. Besides recording videos in Full HD and 4K resolutions you can also use Spark Camera to create voiceovers, remove any segment of a video clip you want or change a clip’s playback speed. In addition, you can set the preferred frame rate for each video you record with Spark Camera and utilize its image stabilization options while shooting under difficult light conditions. Applying a filter to a video you recorded with this app requires you to just swipe left or right while you can adjust their intensity by simply moving your finger up or down.</p>

<p>It has already been five years since Steller was named as one of the best apps on the App Store by Apple, but very little has changed in the meantime. You don’t have to be a professional storyteller in order to create engaging visual stories with this app since you can select a theme you like and let Steller do all the heavy lifting for you. There just ten text styles to choose from and the app doesn’t offer even the basic video editing tools, which limits your options throughout the video editing process. Nonetheless, you can share all video content you edit with Steller directly to your Instagram Stories.</p>

<p>Creating Facebook or Instagram Stories that attract the attention of thousands of daily viewers is what Unfold does best. You can apply ten different filters and effects to all videos you record with this app and then choose from over 150 video templates. Unfold also grants you access to advanced text tools that enable you to customize the messages you want to distribute through social media channels. The free version of Unfold offers only a limited range of options, and you must upgrade to Unfold+ if you want to access all of the themes, fonts, and stickers this app provides. Despite the great user rating, Unfold still lacks video and audio editing tools that would allow its users to manipulate their footage without any restrictions.</p>

<p>iPhone owners in need of a video editing app that allows them to record and edit their footage with professional tools should consider installing 24 FPS. In addition to excellent video recording capabilities, this app features a plethora of options you can use to enhance the colors in the videos you edit. Importing LUTs into 24 FPS is a routine operation that can reduce the amount of time you have to spend on giving a video a particular cinematic style. Skin-thinning and skin smoothing filters enable you to beautify the people in your videos and make them more visually appealing to the online audience. The app’s video editor also contains audio editing options that make creating a video’s soundtrack fun and enjoyable.</p>

The seemingly endless library of royalty-free songs offers you all the resources you are going to need while creating a soundtrack for your video, and you can also control the volume of video’s original sound and audio files you added to a project.</p>

Digital marketers who don’t have the skills or the time to edit their videos with professional video editing software can benefit from this AI-powered editor.

If you opt for the monthly Business subscription plan you will gain access to more than 3 million stock videos and 25 million photos.</p>

<p>The 4.9 User Rating on more than 15.000 reviews speaks volumes about Mojo’s capabilities. Even the free version of the app lets you choose from more than a hundred fully customizable templates. So, once you pick an animated template you just have to add the video and audio files you want to include in the final version of the video and wait for Mojo to generate a new story you can share on social media. However, you must upgrade to the pro version of the app if you want to choose the aspect ratio for all videos you edit with this app or be able to use all of the text styles and templates Mojo offers.</p>

<p>Apple included the Spark Camera app in their selection of the best storytelling apps in 2024, and a brief look at the app’s features shows why. Besides recording videos in Full HD and 4K resolutions you can also use Spark Camera to create voiceovers, remove any segment of a video clip you want or change a clip’s playback speed. In addition, you can set the preferred frame rate for each video you record with Spark Camera and utilize its image stabilization options while shooting under difficult light conditions. Applying a filter to a video you recorded with this app requires you to just swipe left or right while you can adjust their intensity by simply moving your finger up or down.</p>

<p>It has already been five years since Steller was named as one of the best apps on the App Store by Apple, but very little has changed in the meantime. You don’t have to be a professional storyteller in order to create engaging visual stories with this app since you can select a theme you like and let Steller do all the heavy lifting for you. There just ten text styles to choose from and the app doesn’t offer even the basic video editing tools, which limits your options throughout the video editing process. Nonetheless, you can share all video content you edit with Steller directly to your Instagram Stories.</p>

<p>Creating Facebook or Instagram Stories that attract the attention of thousands of daily viewers is what Unfold does best. You can apply ten different filters and effects to all videos you record with this app and then choose from over 150 video templates. Unfold also grants you access to advanced text tools that enable you to customize the messages you want to distribute through social media channels. The free version of Unfold offers only a limited range of options, and you must upgrade to Unfold+ if you want to access all of the themes, fonts, and stickers this app provides. Despite the great user rating, Unfold still lacks video and audio editing tools that would allow its users to manipulate their footage without any restrictions.</p>

<p>iPhone owners in need of a video editing app that allows them to record and edit their footage with professional tools should consider installing 24 FPS. In addition to excellent video recording capabilities, this app features a plethora of options you can use to enhance the colors in the videos you edit. Importing LUTs into 24 FPS is a routine operation that can reduce the amount of time you have to spend on giving a video a particular cinematic style. Skin-thinning and skin smoothing filters enable you to beautify the people in your videos and make them more visually appealing to the online audience. The app’s video editor also contains audio editing options that make creating a video’s soundtrack fun and enjoyable.</p>

The seemingly endless library of royalty-free songs offers you all the resources you are going to need while creating a soundtrack for your video, and you can also control the volume of video’s original sound and audio files you added to a project.</p>

<p>The world is shifting, with more and more businesses and companies using online imagery and video content as a means of reaching their target audience and demographic wherever they may be - and GIF’s represent one of the biggest growing trends of the decade.</p>
<p>But not all GIF’s are perfect. Some react far too quickly, while some are very slow and clunky in their movement – with video editors and animators finding that simply changing the speed of a GIF can have a huge impact on the way it is viewed and used by consumers.</p>

<h3 id="1-EZGIF-com"><a href="#1-EZGIF-com" class="headerlink" title="1. EZGIF.com"></a>1. EZGIF.com</h3><p>This online GIF speed editor offers all the usability of a basic Windows image or video editing program, but with all the technological expertise of a modern video editor. GIF’s can be edited as GIF’s or as MP4 files, and though the site takes a while to download the completed files, the end result is high in quality and creates a seamless pattern of movement. Other features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>No registration is required and there is no user limit – this really is a free editing site</li>
<li>Colour editing and text overlay can be instantly added to any GIF footage</li>
</ul>

<p>To change the speed of your GIF using EzGIF, visit this page <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ezgif.com/speed" >https://ezgif.com/speed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Once your GIF is uploaded to the free-to-use site, you can alter the percentage of current speed using a basic drop down – something which should always be altered based on the idea of 100% representing the original speed. Changing the percentage to 200% will make the GIF run 2x faster, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="2-Veed-io"><a href="#2-Veed-io" class="headerlink" title="2. Veed.io"></a>2. Veed.io</h3><p>This site, found at <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer" >https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great way of editing your GIF speed quickly and easily – using just a few basic steps. Once users have arrived on the site and clicked on the big blue ‘Get Started’ button, they will find themselves faced with a very simple upload tool.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="change gif speed in Veed.io"
                ></p>
<p>From there the size, speed and colouring can be altered on their GIF, with the ability to add music also available. Changing the speed can be done using a selection of pre-programmed buttons – ranging from 0.5x (half the original speed) up to 2x (double the original speed). Users can also select the custom speed button and play around with a speed of their own making.</p>
<h3 id="3-Lunapic"><a href="#3-Lunapic" class="headerlink" title="3. Lunapic"></a>3. Lunapic</h3><p><img

                      alt="change gif speed in Lunapic"
                ></p>
<p>What we like about Lunapic is the way that the site allows us to change not only the GIF speed but also the order in which different images and visuals are presented – giving the user a chance to upload new content to add into their GIF or else simply adjust the speed and timing delay on the original clip. Users can add animation to certain aspects and parts of the video or image and can set the looping option of their GIF to start and end at any point – altering the way the end consumer views the starting image. The speeds included on the site may be determined in advance giving you a limited choice, but the range available means this isn’t too much of a problem.</p>

                      alt="change gif speed in GifGit"
                ></p>
<p>Cheesy website names aside, this online tool is super easy to use with a very basic user interface. Found through this site - <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit" >https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - editing GIF’s is a simple case of uploading the GIF clip and using the Delay tool as a way of setting the speed using the delay of milliseconds on each frame. This number, in the example sitting at 80, refers to the number of milliseconds that will be spent on each frame of the GIF – with a lower number enabling the GIF to move faster while a larger delay number will make your GIF play much slower.</p>
<p>This site is good if you’re happy to experiment with a little trial and error!</p>
<h3 id="5-IMG-Flip"><a href="#5-IMG-Flip" class="headerlink" title="5. IMG Flip"></a>5. IMG Flip</h3><p>As with many online tools, this site does come with limitations – however, in our opinion the vast range of customisable options and editing features outweigh the fact that your GIF’s can only be stored up to 4MB before you have to start paying. For the most part, this is a site which is ideal for those who are simply looking to edit one or two GIF’s – if you’re looking to make a habit of it, then you would be best looking at one of the other sites which offers more in terms of storage and free uses.</p>

A great tool which is instant to use and allows you to create funny and more serious GIFs depending on the movement you capture.</p>

<p>This platform is designed to allow users to edit and add to existing GIFs which they may want to adjust, add filters to and overlay with music. As with many of the other portable device tools created for Android and iPhone, the main features of this app are its user friendly interface and the fact that all GIFs created can be downloaded directly to the phone or uploaded straight to social media – depending on how the user intends to use their GIF.</p>

<p>One of the fastest tools both to understand and to use, GIF studio really lets you feel like you are in a proper video editing studio – even when using the limited screen size of your phone. Users can edit the speed on existing GIFs or can create new collages with multiple GIFs, benefitting from added animation and colour and visual effects without losing the quality of the original imagery or footage.</p>
<h4 id="GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ"><a href="#GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ" class="headerlink" title="GIF Speed Changer FAQ"></a>GIF Speed Changer FAQ</h4><p><strong>Can I slow down a GIF?</strong></p>
<p>In short, yes. How you do this will depend on the platform you use, however for the most part, any platform which allows the GIF to be sped up will also allow you to slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>How do you change the speed of a GIF in PowerPoint?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no tool within PowerPoint that allows users to adjust the speed of an external GIF. The small animations and movements of images and words created and controlled within PowerPoint can be adjusted in the settings of each animation tool – however, at present, GIFs themselves are unable to be altered in PowerPoint itself.</p>
<p><strong>How do you make a GIF 30fps?</strong></p>
<p>This number refers to the frame control time, with most computer displays running at around 60fps. To adjust this number to 30fps, the user will need to enter the settings of the GIF and set the run time at 30 for a delay of 0.03 seconds on each frame.</p>
<p><strong>Why is frame rate important in GIF animation and how do you change frame rate in GIF exportation?</strong></p>
<p>Frame rate comes into play when watching back the GIF as a piece of complete footage – with frame rate affecting the overall smooth transition of the GIF from frame to frame and back to the beginning. If your frame rate isn’t controlled, the finish will be jumpy and won’t look good. When you move to convert and export your GIF, you will have an option to adjust the loop setting and timeline setting – as well as the frames per second. Setting this at 30 will provide you with a seamless and consistently high quality finish – perfect for your brand new GIF.</p>

<p>The world is shifting, with more and more businesses and companies using online imagery and video content as a means of reaching their target audience and demographic wherever they may be - and GIF’s represent one of the biggest growing trends of the decade.</p>
<p>But not all GIF’s are perfect. Some react far too quickly, while some are very slow and clunky in their movement – with video editors and animators finding that simply changing the speed of a GIF can have a huge impact on the way it is viewed and used by consumers.</p>

<h3 id="1-EZGIF-com-1"><a href="#1-EZGIF-com-1" class="headerlink" title="1. EZGIF.com"></a>1. EZGIF.com</h3><p>This online GIF speed editor offers all the usability of a basic Windows image or video editing program, but with all the technological expertise of a modern video editor. GIF’s can be edited as GIF’s or as MP4 files, and though the site takes a while to download the completed files, the end result is high in quality and creates a seamless pattern of movement. Other features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>No registration is required and there is no user limit – this really is a free editing site</li>
<li>Colour editing and text overlay can be instantly added to any GIF footage</li>
</ul>

                      alt="change gif speed in EZgif"
                ></p>
<p>To change the speed of your GIF using EzGIF, visit this page <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ezgif.com/speed" >https://ezgif.com/speed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Once your GIF is uploaded to the free-to-use site, you can alter the percentage of current speed using a basic drop down – something which should always be altered based on the idea of 100% representing the original speed. Changing the percentage to 200% will make the GIF run 2x faster, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="2-Veed-io-1"><a href="#2-Veed-io-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Veed.io"></a>2. Veed.io</h3><p>This site, found at <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer" >https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great way of editing your GIF speed quickly and easily – using just a few basic steps. Once users have arrived on the site and clicked on the big blue ‘Get Started’ button, they will find themselves faced with a very simple upload tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="change gif speed in Veed.io"
                ></p>
<p>From there the size, speed and colouring can be altered on their GIF, with the ability to add music also available. Changing the speed can be done using a selection of pre-programmed buttons – ranging from 0.5x (half the original speed) up to 2x (double the original speed). Users can also select the custom speed button and play around with a speed of their own making.</p>
<h3 id="3-Lunapic-1"><a href="#3-Lunapic-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Lunapic"></a>3. Lunapic</h3><p><img

                      alt="change gif speed in Lunapic"
                ></p>
<p>What we like about Lunapic is the way that the site allows us to change not only the GIF speed but also the order in which different images and visuals are presented – giving the user a chance to upload new content to add into their GIF or else simply adjust the speed and timing delay on the original clip. Users can add animation to certain aspects and parts of the video or image and can set the looping option of their GIF to start and end at any point – altering the way the end consumer views the starting image. The speeds included on the site may be determined in advance giving you a limited choice, but the range available means this isn’t too much of a problem.</p>
<h3 id="4-GifGit-1"><a href="#4-GifGit-1" class="headerlink" title="4. GifGit"></a>4. GifGit</h3><p><img

                      alt="change gif speed in GifGit"
                ></p>
<p>Cheesy website names aside, this online tool is super easy to use with a very basic user interface. Found through this site - <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit" >https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - editing GIF’s is a simple case of uploading the GIF clip and using the Delay tool as a way of setting the speed using the delay of milliseconds on each frame. This number, in the example sitting at 80, refers to the number of milliseconds that will be spent on each frame of the GIF – with a lower number enabling the GIF to move faster while a larger delay number will make your GIF play much slower.</p>
<p>This site is good if you’re happy to experiment with a little trial and error!</p>
<h3 id="5-IMG-Flip-1"><a href="#5-IMG-Flip-1" class="headerlink" title="5. IMG Flip"></a>5. IMG Flip</h3><p>As with many online tools, this site does come with limitations – however, in our opinion the vast range of customisable options and editing features outweigh the fact that your GIF’s can only be stored up to 4MB before you have to start paying. For the most part, this is a site which is ideal for those who are simply looking to edit one or two GIF’s – if you’re looking to make a habit of it, then you would be best looking at one of the other sites which offers more in terms of storage and free uses.</p>

<p>One of the fastest tools both to understand and to use, GIF studio really lets you feel like you are in a proper video editing studio – even when using the limited screen size of your phone. Users can edit the speed on existing GIFs or can create new collages with multiple GIFs, benefitting from added animation and colour and visual effects without losing the quality of the original imagery or footage.</p>
<h4 id="GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ-1"><a href="#GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ-1" class="headerlink" title="GIF Speed Changer FAQ"></a>GIF Speed Changer FAQ</h4><p><strong>Can I slow down a GIF?</strong></p>
<p>In short, yes. How you do this will depend on the platform you use, however for the most part, any platform which allows the GIF to be sped up will also allow you to slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>How do you change the speed of a GIF in PowerPoint?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no tool within PowerPoint that allows users to adjust the speed of an external GIF. The small animations and movements of images and words created and controlled within PowerPoint can be adjusted in the settings of each animation tool – however, at present, GIFs themselves are unable to be altered in PowerPoint itself.</p>
<p><strong>How do you make a GIF 30fps?</strong></p>
<p>This number refers to the frame control time, with most computer displays running at around 60fps. To adjust this number to 30fps, the user will need to enter the settings of the GIF and set the run time at 30 for a delay of 0.03 seconds on each frame.</p>
<p><strong>Why is frame rate important in GIF animation and how do you change frame rate in GIF exportation?</strong></p>
<p>Frame rate comes into play when watching back the GIF as a piece of complete footage – with frame rate affecting the overall smooth transition of the GIF from frame to frame and back to the beginning. If your frame rate isn’t controlled, the finish will be jumpy and won’t look good. When you move to convert and export your GIF, you will have an option to adjust the loop setting and timeline setting – as well as the frames per second. Setting this at 30 will provide you with a seamless and consistently high quality finish – perfect for your brand new GIF.</p>

<p>The world is shifting, with more and more businesses and companies using online imagery and video content as a means of reaching their target audience and demographic wherever they may be - and GIF’s represent one of the biggest growing trends of the decade.</p>
<p>But not all GIF’s are perfect. Some react far too quickly, while some are very slow and clunky in their movement – with video editors and animators finding that simply changing the speed of a GIF can have a huge impact on the way it is viewed and used by consumers.</p>

<li>With your gifs open on the screen, right click and select <strong>Speed</strong> <strong>and Duration</strong> .</li>
<li>In the Custom Speed window, you will see a speed slider locates at the middle, which indicates the default 1.x speed. And the Duration option suggests the duration of the gif.</li>
<li>To change the speed of gif, you can drag the speed slider forward or backward to speed up or slow down the playback. Or, you can just enter the number to a specific duration.</li>

<h3 id="1-EZGIF-com-2"><a href="#1-EZGIF-com-2" class="headerlink" title="1. EZGIF.com"></a>1. EZGIF.com</h3><p>This online GIF speed editor offers all the usability of a basic Windows image or video editing program, but with all the technological expertise of a modern video editor. GIF’s can be edited as GIF’s or as MP4 files, and though the site takes a while to download the completed files, the end result is high in quality and creates a seamless pattern of movement. Other features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>No registration is required and there is no user limit – this really is a free editing site</li>
<li>Colour editing and text overlay can be instantly added to any GIF footage</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-ezgif.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in EZgif"
                ></p>
<p>To change the speed of your GIF using EzGIF, visit this page <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ezgif.com/speed" >https://ezgif.com/speed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Once your GIF is uploaded to the free-to-use site, you can alter the percentage of current speed using a basic drop down – something which should always be altered based on the idea of 100% representing the original speed. Changing the percentage to 200% will make the GIF run 2x faster, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="2-Veed-io-2"><a href="#2-Veed-io-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Veed.io"></a>2. Veed.io</h3><p>This site, found at <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer" >https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great way of editing your GIF speed quickly and easily – using just a few basic steps. Once users have arrived on the site and clicked on the big blue ‘Get Started’ button, they will find themselves faced with a very simple upload tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-veed.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in Veed.io"
                ></p>
<p>From there the size, speed and colouring can be altered on their GIF, with the ability to add music also available. Changing the speed can be done using a selection of pre-programmed buttons – ranging from 0.5x (half the original speed) up to 2x (double the original speed). Users can also select the custom speed button and play around with a speed of their own making.</p>
<h3 id="3-Lunapic-2"><a href="#3-Lunapic-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Lunapic"></a>3. Lunapic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="change gif speed in Lunapic"
                ></p>
<p>What we like about Lunapic is the way that the site allows us to change not only the GIF speed but also the order in which different images and visuals are presented – giving the user a chance to upload new content to add into their GIF or else simply adjust the speed and timing delay on the original clip. Users can add animation to certain aspects and parts of the video or image and can set the looping option of their GIF to start and end at any point – altering the way the end consumer views the starting image. The speeds included on the site may be determined in advance giving you a limited choice, but the range available means this isn’t too much of a problem.</p>
<h3 id="4-GifGit-2"><a href="#4-GifGit-2" class="headerlink" title="4. GifGit"></a>4. GifGit</h3><p><img

                      alt="change gif speed in GifGit"
                ></p>
<p>Cheesy website names aside, this online tool is super easy to use with a very basic user interface. Found through this site - <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit" >https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - editing GIF’s is a simple case of uploading the GIF clip and using the Delay tool as a way of setting the speed using the delay of milliseconds on each frame. This number, in the example sitting at 80, refers to the number of milliseconds that will be spent on each frame of the GIF – with a lower number enabling the GIF to move faster while a larger delay number will make your GIF play much slower.</p>
<p>This site is good if you’re happy to experiment with a little trial and error!</p>
<h3 id="5-IMG-Flip-2"><a href="#5-IMG-Flip-2" class="headerlink" title="5. IMG Flip"></a>5. IMG Flip</h3><p>As with many online tools, this site does come with limitations – however, in our opinion the vast range of customisable options and editing features outweigh the fact that your GIF’s can only be stored up to 4MB before you have to start paying. For the most part, this is a site which is ideal for those who are simply looking to edit one or two GIF’s – if you’re looking to make a habit of it, then you would be best looking at one of the other sites which offers more in terms of storage and free uses.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

To change the speed you simply need upload your clip and then adjust the speed as a percentage of the original clip – 100% being the starting point, with 200% running the GIF at twice the speed and 50% running it at half speed.</p>

<p>We start with a simple one which can be found on the app store using any search for a GIF app. This particular app plays on the concept of building your own memes, giving users a chance to enhance their own comic value on platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook using their own images or multiple GIF’s strung together. We particularly love the fact that ImgPlay’s platform allows users to add their own text and emojis over the top of the visuals, completely personalising the end product and creating something which is unique for their own use. A simple slider tool allows for easy editing of the GIF speed, presenting an all-round great tool for beginners and experience GIF makers alike.</p>

As much an online community as a GIF editing tool, Imgur could well be the new Instagram – if Instagram suddenly decided to wave goodbye to the influencers and adverts and make way for user built content and humorous motion videos instead!</p>

<p>But not all GIF’s are perfect. Some react far too quickly, while some are very slow and clunky in their movement – with video editors and animators finding that simply changing the speed of a GIF can have a huge impact on the way it is viewed and used by consumers.</p>

<h3 id="1-EZGIF-com-3"><a href="#1-EZGIF-com-3" class="headerlink" title="1. EZGIF.com"></a>1. EZGIF.com</h3><p>This online GIF speed editor offers all the usability of a basic Windows image or video editing program, but with all the technological expertise of a modern video editor. GIF’s can be edited as GIF’s or as MP4 files, and though the site takes a while to download the completed files, the end result is high in quality and creates a seamless pattern of movement. Other features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>No registration is required and there is no user limit – this really is a free editing site</li>
<li>Colour editing and text overlay can be instantly added to any GIF footage</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-ezgif.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in EZgif"
                ></p>
<p>To change the speed of your GIF using EzGIF, visit this page <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ezgif.com/speed" >https://ezgif.com/speed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Once your GIF is uploaded to the free-to-use site, you can alter the percentage of current speed using a basic drop down – something which should always be altered based on the idea of 100% representing the original speed. Changing the percentage to 200% will make the GIF run 2x faster, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="2-Veed-io-3"><a href="#2-Veed-io-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Veed.io"></a>2. Veed.io</h3><p>This site, found at <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer" >https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great way of editing your GIF speed quickly and easily – using just a few basic steps. Once users have arrived on the site and clicked on the big blue ‘Get Started’ button, they will find themselves faced with a very simple upload tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-veed.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in Veed.io"
                ></p>
<p>From there the size, speed and colouring can be altered on their GIF, with the ability to add music also available. Changing the speed can be done using a selection of pre-programmed buttons – ranging from 0.5x (half the original speed) up to 2x (double the original speed). Users can also select the custom speed button and play around with a speed of their own making.</p>
<h3 id="3-Lunapic-3"><a href="#3-Lunapic-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Lunapic"></a>3. Lunapic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="change gif speed in Lunapic"
                ></p>
<p>What we like about Lunapic is the way that the site allows us to change not only the GIF speed but also the order in which different images and visuals are presented – giving the user a chance to upload new content to add into their GIF or else simply adjust the speed and timing delay on the original clip. Users can add animation to certain aspects and parts of the video or image and can set the looping option of their GIF to start and end at any point – altering the way the end consumer views the starting image. The speeds included on the site may be determined in advance giving you a limited choice, but the range available means this isn’t too much of a problem.</p>
<h3 id="4-GifGit-3"><a href="#4-GifGit-3" class="headerlink" title="4. GifGit"></a>4. GifGit</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change gif speed in GifGit"
                ></p>
<p>Cheesy website names aside, this online tool is super easy to use with a very basic user interface. Found through this site - <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit" >https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - editing GIF’s is a simple case of uploading the GIF clip and using the Delay tool as a way of setting the speed using the delay of milliseconds on each frame. This number, in the example sitting at 80, refers to the number of milliseconds that will be spent on each frame of the GIF – with a lower number enabling the GIF to move faster while a larger delay number will make your GIF play much slower.</p>
<p>This site is good if you’re happy to experiment with a little trial and error!</p>
<h3 id="5-IMG-Flip-3"><a href="#5-IMG-Flip-3" class="headerlink" title="5. IMG Flip"></a>5. IMG Flip</h3><p>As with many online tools, this site does come with limitations – however, in our opinion the vast range of customisable options and editing features outweigh the fact that your GIF’s can only be stored up to 4MB before you have to start paying. For the most part, this is a site which is ideal for those who are simply looking to edit one or two GIF’s – if you’re looking to make a habit of it, then you would be best looking at one of the other sites which offers more in terms of storage and free uses.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

To change the speed you simply need upload your clip and then adjust the speed as a percentage of the original clip – 100% being the starting point, with 200% running the GIF at twice the speed and 50% running it at half speed.</p>

<p>We start with a simple one which can be found on the app store using any search for a GIF app. This particular app plays on the concept of building your own memes, giving users a chance to enhance their own comic value on platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook using their own images or multiple GIF’s strung together. We particularly love the fact that ImgPlay’s platform allows users to add their own text and emojis over the top of the visuals, completely personalising the end product and creating something which is unique for their own use. A simple slider tool allows for easy editing of the GIF speed, presenting an all-round great tool for beginners and experience GIF makers alike.</p>

<p>The Imgur app is one of the most popular GIF creation tools out there – offering users with a platform which allows them edit as many GIFs as they like, play with the speed of existing and new GIFs, and share their creations with other users who can share your designs and help you go viral. As much an online community as a GIF editing tool, Imgur could well be the new Instagram – if Instagram suddenly decided to wave goodbye to the influencers and adverts and make way for user built content and humorous motion videos instead!</p>

<h4 id="GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ-3"><a href="#GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ-3" class="headerlink" title="GIF Speed Changer FAQ"></a>GIF Speed Changer FAQ</h4><p><strong>Can I slow down a GIF?</strong></p>
<p>In short, yes. How you do this will depend on the platform you use, however for the most part, any platform which allows the GIF to be sped up will also allow you to slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>How do you change the speed of a GIF in PowerPoint?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no tool within PowerPoint that allows users to adjust the speed of an external GIF. The small animations and movements of images and words created and controlled within PowerPoint can be adjusted in the settings of each animation tool – however, at present, GIFs themselves are unable to be altered in PowerPoint itself.</p>
<p><strong>How do you make a GIF 30fps?</strong></p>
<p>This number refers to the frame control time, with most computer displays running at around 60fps. To adjust this number to 30fps, the user will need to enter the settings of the GIF and set the run time at 30 for a delay of 0.03 seconds on each frame.</p>
<p><strong>Why is frame rate important in GIF animation and how do you change frame rate in GIF exportation?</strong></p>
<p>Frame rate comes into play when watching back the GIF as a piece of complete footage – with frame rate affecting the overall smooth transition of the GIF from frame to frame and back to the beginning. If your frame rate isn’t controlled, the finish will be jumpy and won’t look good. When you move to convert and export your GIF, you will have an option to adjust the loop setting and timeline setting – as well as the frames per second. Setting this at 30 will provide you with a seamless and consistently high quality finish – perfect for your brand new GIF.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Slow Down the Playback Speed</strong></p>
<p>Ensure that the uploaded video is successfully added to the Timeline at the bottom, click to select the clip if not already selected, confirm that the <strong>EDIT</strong> tab is selected from the top of the right pane, and use the <strong>–</strong> and <strong>+</strong> buttons under the <strong>SPEED</strong> section to decrease and increase the playback speed of the footage respectively.</p>
<p>To make a slow motion with Kapwing, you can click the <strong>–</strong> icon and choose 0.25X, 0.5X and 0.75X slower based on your need. You can see the changes in the timeline when you apply the speed presets.</p>

Many people use both Instagram and WhatsApp to update their status. It happens that, at times, you might want to save your friends’ statuses as a remembrance or for some other reason.

                ></p>
<p>Step 5: From here you can copy any file and then save it to another folder to watch or share later on.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Save It with Third-Party App</strong></p>

<p>Step 2: In order to save someone’s WhatsApp status, you must first view it in WhatsApp. After watching the status, open the Status Saver app.</p>
<p>Step 3: When you open it, you will see all the statuses you have seen on WhatsApp. Tap on the movie or image you wish to save, then click the download icon at the bottom. The share icon on the right allows you to share the status with WhatsApp contacts, Instagram, Facebook, and other networks.</p>

Many people use both Instagram and WhatsApp to update their status. It happens that, at times, you might want to save your friends’ statuses as a remembrance or for some other reason. While photos can be screenshotted, videos require the help of the File Manager or any third-party app.</p>
<p>Below are the steps you need to follow for saving WhatsApp status and then sharing it further.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Save It with File Manager</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: View the status that you wish to save. This creates a temporary copy on the phone’s storage.</p>
<p>Step 2: Open your <strong>File Manager app</strong>. Click on the hamburger icon (three dots) present on the right corner of the screen.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="file manager app show hidden files"
                ></p>
<p> Step 3: On the next screen of Settings, you can enable the option of show hidden files. Go to the internal storage of the device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="file manager whatsapp files"
                ></p>
<p> Step 4: Look for the WhatsApp folder, go to ‘Media’ and then click on the folder ‘.Statuses’</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/file-manager-whatsapp-statuses.jpg"
                      alt="file manager whatsapp statuses"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: From here you can copy any file and then save it to another folder to watch or share later on.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Save It with Third-Party App</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: First, download the app <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.downlood.sav.whmedia&hl=en_US&gl=US" >‘Status Saver – Downloader for WhatsApp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.’ And open the app and grant it storage access.</p>
<p>Step 2: In order to save someone’s WhatsApp status, you must first view it in WhatsApp. After watching the status, open the Status Saver app.</p>
<p>Step 3: When you open it, you will see all the statuses you have seen on WhatsApp. Tap on the movie or image you wish to save, then click the download icon at the bottom. The share icon on the right allows you to share the status with WhatsApp contacts, Instagram, Facebook, and other networks.</p>

<p>It’s only possible for someone to see your status updates if both of you have each other’s phone numbers in your phone’s address book.

Unless you change this setting, your status updates are visible to everyone on your contact list.</p>
