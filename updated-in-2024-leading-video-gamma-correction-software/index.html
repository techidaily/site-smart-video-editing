With keyframes, you may modify the white balance, exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, and black point, among other things. Modifications for Saturation, Vibrance, Faded Film and Sharpen are also accessible.</p>
<h3 id="5-Final-Cut-Pro-3"><a href="#5-Final-Cut-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Final Cut Pro"></a>5. Final Cut Pro</h3><p>Final Cut Pro comes with a set of robust manual color correction features that can be used to achieve a wide range of color correction and enhancement features. Creating a color correction effect and then modifying the effect’s settings in the Color inspector is how you utilize the tools. Any of the following color correction effects may be used to make manual color modifications to the color tint, brightness, and contrast of the entire clip picture.</p>
<p>Color correction capabilities in Final Cut Pro allow you to fine-tune the look of any video in your project, including still photos, by adjusting color balance, shadow levels, mid-tone thresholds, highlight levels, and much more. Saturation, exposure, and color modifications are all controlled via the Color Board. Adjust the Brightness in the color adjustment panels to brighten your movies.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Adjusting brightness has become a “small problem” for many. Oftentimes, you record a video, and it falls short of the brightness criteria – it’s too dark! However, when you have quality <strong>Video Brightness Editors</strong>, like the ones we have reviewed above, you’re in good hands. Not only are these apps easy to use with excellent functionality, but they also make editing a piece of cake for everyone.</p>

<h3 id="Ease-of-use-and-interface-3"><a href="#Ease-of-use-and-interface-3" class="headerlink" title="Ease of use and interface"></a><strong>Ease of use and interface</strong></h3><p>With VideoPad’s easy-to-use interface and well-organized conventions, movie makers of any skill level can become familiar with its basics in no time at all. You will become fluent in no time at all in opening and closing windows, stringing clips together, and adding narration, transitions, and text to create a powerful visual presentation. Adding video, audio, and still, photo assets to the files pane will put them on the timeline and allow you to assemble your story.</p>
<p>Videos and still images are organized into bins by the app, ensuring they don’t get confused on the timeline, which speeds up the workflow, especially for newcomers.</p>
<p>The app uses menus and can be dragged and dropped, so a single objective can be accomplished in different ways. You can control all functions from within the application frame, or dockable panels can be used to get a closer look at what needs to be done. A permanent reorganization of the workspace would be appreciated.</p>
<h3 id="Videopad-Video-Editing-Features-3"><a href="#Videopad-Video-Editing-Features-3" class="headerlink" title="Videopad Video Editing Features"></a><strong>Videopad Video Editing Features</strong></h3><p>VideoPad is the perfect balance between too much and not enough. Although there are not many options, it offers a reasonable selection of transitions for moving between clips and images, as well as a selection of filters to give them a unique look. In addition to editing 360-degree video, video stabilization is another helpful feature.</p>
<p>Each filter can be previewed with a click before applying it, and You can combine several to create a custom effect or template for reuse. You can also adjust their length via menus.</p>
<p>A video can be enhanced with transitions, visual effects, overlays, and text using VideoPad. Also included are some basic audio tools and a library of sound effects and atmospheric background music. There are a number of features that allow you to optimize videos, including color correction, adding digital images, adding subtitles, and adjusting the speed of playback. With its video stabilization feature, you can reduce camera shake, and the high-end version supports special effect plugins, but only for Windows.</p>
<h3 id="Videopad-Audio-Editing-Features-3"><a href="#Videopad-Audio-Editing-Features-3" class="headerlink" title="Videopad Audio Editing Features"></a><strong>Videopad Audio Editing Features</strong></h3><p>VideoPad offers a limited set of audio tools, but it does allow you to mix multiple audio tracks, music, and narration to create a movie soundtrack. A video clip’s audio can be faded, mixed, and adjusted for volume, but if you want to go further, you’ll need an external mixer or editor. From VideoPad’s main menu, you can download NCH’s own WavePad.</p>
<p>While the text-to-speech features always sounded false, you can record narration directly within the program. There is a great idea in having voice recognition for subtitles, which is only available on the Windows version. However, the implementation falls short of expectations. Although the video was clearly spoken in a quiet environment, it automatically failed to translate into subtitles.</p>
<h3 id="Videopad-Content-Sharing-features-3"><a href="#Videopad-Content-Sharing-features-3" class="headerlink" title="Videopad Content Sharing features"></a><strong>Videopad Content Sharing features</strong></h3><p>Video creators who publish to YouTube or other social media platforms can use the software because it allows them to share videos directly to platforms such as Dropbox, Flickr, Google Drive, and Vimeo.

<h3 id="Is-VideoPad-worth-buying-3"><a href="#Is-VideoPad-worth-buying-3" class="headerlink" title="Is VideoPad worth buying?"></a><strong>Is VideoPad worth buying?</strong></h3><p>Although the VideoPad video editor free version is somewhat limited, it functions as a free trial to see if you like it enough to upgrade.

<h2 id="Our-Recommendation-3"><a href="#Our-Recommendation-3" class="headerlink" title="Our Recommendation"></a><strong>Our Recommendation</strong></h2><p>As a beginner, you may be looking to use Videopad free, but when it comes to features, it just falls short compared to modern video editors.

<h2 id="GoPro-Quik-PC-An-Overview-3"><a href="#GoPro-Quik-PC-An-Overview-3" class="headerlink" title="GoPro Quik PC- An Overview"></a><strong>GoPro Quik PC- An Overview</strong></h2><p>Do you need an app for editing GoPro videos and photos? If the answer is yes, then you should go for GoPro Quik for Desktop. GoPro Quik is a video editing software that allows you to edit your GoPro videos and photos within no time. The app comes with a very simple user interface that will help you quickly edit your videos. GoPro Quik for desktop was created to meet your basic needs and wants when it comes to editing GoPro photos and videos. You can easily edit your GoPro photos and videos using this app. This app will help you in creating post-production videos like a pro.</p>
<p>The best thing about GoPro Quick for Desktop is that it is free to use and is available easily for both 32 bit and 64 bit systems. It also has a simple and intuitive interface that anyone can adopt, even if you don’t have any prior experience with this video editing app. It basically allows you to import your GoPro clips, highlight your favorite clips, and then it edits your video for you–including adding music. The process is pretty quick, as the name suggests.</p>
<h2 id="GoPro-Quik-Windows-Features-3"><a href="#GoPro-Quik-Windows-Features-3" class="headerlink" title="GoPro Quik Windows Features"></a><strong>GoPro Quik Windows Features</strong></h2><p>GoPro Quik app is rich with features, and it provides pretty much everything that you need to create amazing photos and videos. A few highlighting features are discussed below:</p>
<h3 id="1-Create-Amazing-Videos-In-Just-A-Few-Clicks-3"><a href="#1-Create-Amazing-Videos-In-Just-A-Few-Clicks-3" class="headerlink" title="1.Create Amazing Videos In Just A Few Clicks"></a>1.Create Amazing Videos In Just A Few Clicks</h3><p>With GoPro Quik, making amazing videos is very easy. With just a few clicks, you can import all your videos and photos. Then you can edit them in just a few clicks. Everything here is so simple that you will feel like a pro video editor yourself.</p>
<h3 id="2-Auto-Cloud-Uploads-3"><a href="#2-Auto-Cloud-Uploads-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Auto Cloud Uploads"></a>2.Auto Cloud Uploads</h3><p>Another amazing feature of GoPro Quik is that once you have done editing your videos, they will be automatically uploaded to your cloud. But for this feature to work, make sure that you have an active GoPro PLUS subscription.</p>
<h3 id="3-Excellent-editing-3"><a href="#3-Excellent-editing-3" class="headerlink" title="3.Excellent editing"></a>3.Excellent editing</h3><p>Simply click a few buttons to turn GoPro footage into an awesome video. Pick the perfect soundtrack, then pick your favorite moments. Your video automatically syncs with the music, so you can share it in just a few seconds. Make your videos come alive with panning effects by adding photos and time-lapse sequences.</p>
<h3 id="4-Share-with-friends-3"><a href="#4-Share-with-friends-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Share with friends"></a>4.Share with friends</h3><p>Make short videos that are ideal for posting on Facebook, YouTube, and more. Make a unique video from your burst and timelapse photos. Additionally, you can find and save the most memorable moments in a video, then share them as high-quality still images.</p>
<h3 id="5-New-Speed-Tool-3"><a href="#5-New-Speed-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="5.New Speed Tool"></a>5.New Speed Tool</h3><p>Tap the pencil to choose the Speed icon for the video in your Media Mural. Then you can apply more than one-speed effect simultaneously. The speed can be toggled between real-time and half-speed slow motion. You can also add freeze frames for a specified period of time.</p>
<h3 id="6-GoPro-Exclusive-filters-3"><a href="#6-GoPro-Exclusive-filters-3" class="headerlink" title="6.GoPro-Exclusive filters"></a>6.GoPro-Exclusive filters</h3><p>From Media or Mural, select a photo or video and tap the pencil. In order to optimize the footage to the environment it was shot in, GoPro has created 25 filters in-house. By using the scrub bar, you can adjust the intensity of each filter.</p>
<h3 id="7-Premium-Themes-3"><a href="#7-Premium-Themes-3" class="headerlink" title="7.Premium Themes"></a>7.Premium Themes</h3><p>Alternatively, you may create a new highlight from Media. You will be presented with 13 video editing themes. Besides adding text and transitions, you can also change the music, choose the duration, and choose the right format for your intended sharing platform, such as social media or text.</p>
<h5 id="Pros-3"><a href="#Pros-3" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Despite its ease and quickness, there are a few drawbacks to it. First, I must say this is awesome and perfect for anyone who has never edited a GoPro video before. When you’re new to video editing software, it can be very easy to become frustrated and overwhelmed, so it’s great for those who aren’t familiar with it. It’s all about getting that video off your memory card and putting it out there. That’s it.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-3"><a href="#Cons-3" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>You cannot edit footage from your phone or DSLR with Quik App for Desktop - only GoPro footage can be used in Quik App. This is a GoPro app, after all. It should be used with GoPro content!</p>
<p>In addition to the ten free songs, GoPro Plus members have access to an additional song library. Users cannot import their own music either.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may only create a certain number of Highlights. Each 30-second video is limited to 10 Highlights.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Verdict-3"><a href="#Final-Verdict-3" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p>Although GoPro Quik is amazing and comes with a lot of features, there are still many limitations of this application, as discussed in the cons section of this article. If you want to do basic editing, then this app will do just good, but if you are looking for advanced features like audio normalization, keyframing, color tuning, gif support, etc., then you will have to use another fully-fledged video editing app. We recommend you to give a try to our <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> video editor.</p>
