<p> Instagram’s announcement that the stop motion feature will become available in the Stories section created quite a buzz on the Internet, a while ago. In 2020, the feature remains relatively unknown to social media users, even though on paper it seemed promising.</p>
<p> Stop motion videos, are simply sequentially taken photos that create an illusion of movement once they are played one after the other. These <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >types of videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are growing more popular on social media, as they can make Instagram stories or any other social media feed more interesting. You are at the right place if you would like to join video content creators who already <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >produce stop motion videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> because in this article we are going to show you how to make a stop motion video on Instagram.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Stop-Motion-Video-on-Instagram"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Stop-Motion-Video-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Make a Stop Motion Video on Instagram?"></a>Part 1: How to Make a Stop Motion Video on Instagram?</h2><p> The technical side of making a stop motion video on Instagram is rather simple since you can enable this feature in just a few taps. After you launch the app, you should tap on the <strong>Camera</strong> icon in the upper left corner of the screen. The new window will open where you can choose the type of Instagram story you want to create, so you can pick to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >go live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, record a video normally or use the app’s Boomerang feature.</p>
<p> You will find the Stop Motion option at the end of this menu, and after you tap on it you just have to press the white button in the middle of the toolbar that is located near the bottom of the screen in order to start taking pictures.</p>
<p> Currently, Instagram limits the number of photos you can take with the stop motion feature to ten. Tap on the Done button that is located at the top of the screen once you completed the process of making a stop motion video and then proceed to choose stickers you would like to include in the story you created. Press the Send To button and decide if you want to share the stop motion video to your Instagram or Facebook story or with some of your Instagram followers. ;</p>

<p> Instagram’s announcement that the stop motion feature will become available in the Stories section created quite a buzz on the Internet, a while ago. In 2020, the feature remains relatively unknown to social media users, even though on paper it seemed promising.</p>
<p> Stop motion videos, are simply sequentially taken photos that create an illusion of movement once they are played one after the other. These <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >types of videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are growing more popular on social media, as they can make Instagram stories or any other social media feed more interesting. You are at the right place if you would like to join video content creators who already <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >produce stop motion videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> because in this article we are going to show you how to make a stop motion video on Instagram.</p>

After you launch the app, you should tap on the <strong>Camera</strong> icon in the upper left corner of the screen. The new window will open where you can choose the type of Instagram story you want to create, so you can pick to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >go live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, record a video normally or use the app’s Boomerang feature.</p>
<p> You will find the Stop Motion option at the end of this menu, and after you tap on it you just have to press the white button in the middle of the toolbar that is located near the bottom of the screen in order to start taking pictures.</p>
<p> Currently, Instagram limits the number of photos you can take with the stop motion feature to ten. Tap on the Done button that is located at the top of the screen once you completed the process of making a stop motion video and then proceed to choose stickers you would like to include in the story you created. Press the Send To button and decide if you want to share the stop motion video to your Instagram or Facebook story or with some of your Instagram followers. ;</p>

<p> Instagram’s announcement that the stop motion feature will become available in the Stories section created quite a buzz on the Internet, a while ago. In 2020, the feature remains relatively unknown to social media users, even though on paper it seemed promising.</p>
<p> Stop motion videos, are simply sequentially taken photos that create an illusion of movement once they are played one after the other. These <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >types of videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are growing more popular on social media, as they can make Instagram stories or any other social media feed more interesting. You are at the right place if you would like to join video content creators who already <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >produce stop motion videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> because in this article we are going to show you how to make a stop motion video on Instagram.</p>

After you launch the app, you should tap on the <strong>Camera</strong> icon in the upper left corner of the screen. The new window will open where you can choose the type of Instagram story you want to create, so you can pick to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >go live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, record a video normally or use the app’s Boomerang feature.</p>
<p> You will find the Stop Motion option at the end of this menu, and after you tap on it you just have to press the white button in the middle of the toolbar that is located near the bottom of the screen in order to start taking pictures.</p>
<p> Currently, Instagram limits the number of photos you can take with the stop motion feature to ten. Tap on the Done button that is located at the top of the screen once you completed the process of making a stop motion video and then proceed to choose stickers you would like to include in the story you created. Press the Send To button and decide if you want to share the stop motion video to your Instagram or Facebook story or with some of your Instagram followers. ;</p>

<p> Like all other Instagram stories, stop motion videos created with this app are only available for 24 hours if you don’t save them on your phone. Moreover, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >downloading the stories you create with Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’s stop motion tool will enable you to edit them with <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing apps for iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Android devices and post them to any social media platform you choose.</p>

If the issue persists, you should opt for some other stop motion app you can use free of charge. ;</p>

With so many different options on the market, finding the app that provides you with all features you need to create stop motion videos can be a difficult task. That’s why we shortlisted the three best apps for iPhones and Android devices that enable you to make animated stop motion videos for Instagram.</p>
<h3 id="1-Over-2"><a href="#1-Over-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Over"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.madewithover.com/" >Over <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, offers in-app purchase</p>

However, the free version of the app offers only limited capabilities, and you must upgrade to the Pro version if you want to have access to all photo and video editing tools Over have to offer.</p>

<p> Creating content for social media with Mojo is a simple process that can be completed in just three easy steps. You don’t even need a Mojo account to start creating stories with this app. All you have to do is select an animated template, import videos or photos and edit it before tapping on the share button. There are more than a hundred animated templates to choose from, so after you pick one, you just have to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add text overlays <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but you must purchase Mojo Pro if you want to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >change aspect ratios <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, duplicate stories or have access to all text styles and templates.</p>

                ></p>
<p> The fact that more than a million video content creators and brands are using Life Lapse to make stop motion videos says a lot about the app’s capabilities. Unlike Over and Mojo, Life Lapse lets you set the exposure and focus locks, switch on a grid or use the ghosted image overlay. Besides capturing photos and videos, the app also allows you to import photos you want to include in the stop motion animation. Furthermore, even the free version of Life Lapse offers a variety of video editing tools that allow you to crop images or adjust saturation, brightness or white balance values in each frame.</p>

As soon as the camera loads you’ll be asked to choose if you would like to create a photo or a video project. Tap on the photo option and start taking photos of the objects or people you want to include in your stop motion video.</p>
<p> The app also grants you access to a broad range of tools that will make composing the shots easier or reduce the flickering effect. Even though Life Lapse doesn’t limit the maximum duration of the stop motion videos you can create with it, an Instagram story cannot be longer than 15 seconds. Furthermore, changing a video’s aspect ratio to 9:16 is recommended, as it will enable you to know exactly how your stop motion video is going to look like after you upload it to Instagram.</p>

Even so, working on a stop motion project requires previous preparations. Here are a few tips that will help you make a better stop motion animation video.</p>
<h3 id="1-Develop-a-concept-2"><a href="#1-Develop-a-concept-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Develop a concept"></a>1. Develop a concept</h3><p> What is your stop motion video about? This is the first and the most important question you will have to answer before you start making a stop motion video. Developing a concept will enable you to know which props you are going to need or how many actors you have to find before you can actually start shooting. Stop motion videos can be virtually about anything, and you should choose a story that will keep the audience interested from start to finish.</p>
<h3 id="2-Shoot-in-studio-conditions-2"><a href="#2-Shoot-in-studio-conditions-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Shoot in studio conditions"></a>2. Shoot in studio conditions</h3><p> Although it is not impossible to make a stop motion video in outdoor conditions, having control over sudden light changes is. That is why it is much better to shoot stop motion videos in studio-like conditions where you can easily adjust all the parameters in accordance with the demands of the project you’re working on. In addition, it is paramount to keep your phone perfectly steady, which is why it is better to mount it on a tripod than to shoot handheld.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Instagram’s stop motion feature is still under development and it may be some time before you can use it to create professional-looking videos. Apps like Over or Life Lapse are a much better option for all video content creators who would like to impress their audience with stop motion videos.

As soon as the camera loads you’ll be asked to choose if you would like to create a photo or a video project. Tap on the photo option and start taking photos of the objects or people you want to include in your stop motion video.</p>
<p> The app also grants you access to a broad range of tools that will make composing the shots easier or reduce the flickering effect. Even though Life Lapse doesn’t limit the maximum duration of the stop motion videos you can create with it, an Instagram story cannot be longer than 15 seconds. Furthermore, changing a video’s aspect ratio to 9:16 is recommended, as it will enable you to know exactly how your stop motion video is going to look like after you upload it to Instagram.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Tips-for-Creating-Stop-Motion-Videos-for-Instagram-3"><a href="#Part-4-Tips-for-Creating-Stop-Motion-Videos-for-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Tips for Creating Stop Motion Videos for Instagram"></a>Part 4: Tips for Creating Stop Motion Videos for Instagram</h2><p> The process of making a stop motion animation is not technically complicated since you just need to place your phone on a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >tripod <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and take a photo each time you move an object in the shot. Even so, working on a stop motion project requires previous preparations. Here are a few tips that will help you make a better stop motion animation video.</p>
<h3 id="1-Develop-a-concept-3"><a href="#1-Develop-a-concept-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Develop a concept"></a>1. Develop a concept</h3><p> What is your stop motion video about? This is the first and the most important question you will have to answer before you start making a stop motion video. Developing a concept will enable you to know which props you are going to need or how many actors you have to find before you can actually start shooting. Stop motion videos can be virtually about anything, and you should choose a story that will keep the audience interested from start to finish.</p>
<h3 id="2-Shoot-in-studio-conditions-3"><a href="#2-Shoot-in-studio-conditions-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Shoot in studio conditions"></a>2. Shoot in studio conditions</h3><p> Although it is not impossible to make a stop motion video in outdoor conditions, having control over sudden light changes is. That is why it is much better to shoot stop motion videos in studio-like conditions where you can easily adjust all the parameters in accordance with the demands of the project you’re working on. In addition, it is paramount to keep your phone perfectly steady, which is why it is better to mount it on a tripod than to shoot handheld.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Instagram’s stop motion feature is still under development and it may be some time before you can use it to create professional-looking videos. Apps like Over or Life Lapse are a much better option for all video content creators who would like to impress their audience with stop motion videos. Which app are you using to create stop motion videos? Leave a comment and let us know.</p>

<h4 id="1-ClipChamp"><a href="#1-ClipChamp" class="headerlink" title="1. ClipChamp"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://clipchamp.com/en/video-editor" >ClipChamp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, pricing options start at $9.00 per month</p>
<p>Before you can start editing a WebM video with Clipchamp, you must first set up an account. This online video editor already has more than 7 million registered users, which speaks volumes about its capabilities. You can choose from a broad range of fully customizable video templates that are optimized for use on different social networks and save you time on performing the video editing tasks on your own.</p>
<p>Clipchamp features impressive stock audio and video libraries you can use to create soundtracks or as a source of complementary footage for your WebM videos. The free version of this online video editor only lets you export videos in 480p resolution and you cannot use the stock footage for free.</p>
<h4 id="2-WeVideo"><a href="#2-WeVideo" class="headerlink" title="2. WeVideo"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wevideo.com/" >WeVideo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, pricing options start at $4.99 per month</p>
<p>This video editing platform offers a broad range of video editing options, so you will have very little trouble turning your footage saved in WebM format into attention-grabbing videos. The video editing tools you will have at your disposal depending on the subscription model you purchase.</p>
<p>With the Free version of WeVideo, you will only have five minutes of publishing time, you won’t be able to export WebM videos in resolutions larger than 480p and each video you create is going to be watermarked. That is why you must opt for Power, Unlimited, Professional or Business subscription package if you want your WebM videos to really stand out on social media.</p>
<h4 id="3-Magisto"><a href="#3-Magisto" class="headerlink" title="3. Magisto"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.magisto.com/" >Magisto <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, pricing options start at $4.99</p>

In addition, you can choose from hundreds of customizable templates that can be used to promote a business or to create a Valentine’s Day video.</p>
<p>The duration of the videos you can create with Magisto depends on the subscription model you have, but even if you choose the most expensive version of Magisto you are still not going to be able to export videos that are longer than 10 minutes.</p>
<h4 id="4-Online-UniConverter"><a href="#4-Online-UniConverter" class="headerlink" title="4. Online UniConverter"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.media.io/video-editor.html" >Online UniConverter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, pricing options start at $2.95 per month</p>
<p>Online UniConverter can be used to convert, compress or edit audio and video files for free, although your options are going to be limited if you opt for the free version of the web-based application. The free Video Editor enables you to perform basic video editing actions like trimming, cropping or rotating videos. In addition, you can adjust the Hue, Saturation or Brightness values of all WebM files you edit with Online UniConverter.</p>
<p>None of the videos you edit with this web-based video editor are going to be watermarked, but exporting videos in resolutions larger than 1080p isn’t an option.</p>
<h4 id="5-Aconvert"><a href="#5-Aconvert" class="headerlink" title="5. Aconvert"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aconvert.com/video/" >Aconvert <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p>Even though this is primarily a file conversion platform that enables you to change the format of images, PDF, audio or video files, you can also use Aconvert to edit your WebM videos. You can’t do much more other than cut, crop, rotate or merge video clips. In addition, you cannot upload video clips that are larger than 200MB to this platform which can make the video editing process difficult, since WebM videos can easily exceed this size limit.</p>
<p>Aconvert is far from being a perfect WebM video editor, but it still offers enough video editing options to enable you to create videos you can share online.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-Free-Desktop-WebM-Video-Editors"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-Free-Desktop-WebM-Video-Editors" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best Free Desktop WebM Video Editors"></a>Part 2: 5 Best Free Desktop WebM Video Editors</h2><p>Desktop-based video editing software products are commonly much more powerful than those that can only be used online, which makes <strong>editing WebM videos</strong> somewhat easier.

<h4 id="1-VSDC"><a href="#1-VSDC" class="headerlink" title="1.

<p>Editing WebM videos with VSDC isn’t any different than editing any other type of video since you just have to import a video into the editor, add it to the timeline and then remove all segments you don’t want to use. VSDC’s intuitive interface makes cutting, cropping or masking videos easy, as you can access any of these options with a single click. Moreover, the Video Stabilization tool enables you to turn shaky footage into perfectly smooth shots.</p>
<p>VSDC features a YouTube uploader and it lets you share your WebM videos to Facebook, Instagram or Vimeo. In addition, you can use this video editing software to change the format of your video files.</p>

In addition to converting WebM video files, you can also edit this type of file with VLC. This media player grants you access to a variety of filters, effects and color adjustment options you can use to polish your WebM videos.</p>
<p>Moreover, VLC lets you trim or crop each video you open with it so that you can remove the parts of the WebM videos you don’t want to share with your online audience. Even so, the process of editing a video with VLC can be too complicated for PC and Mac users who are not tech-savvy.</p>

<p>Before you can start editing a WebM video with Clipchamp, you must first set up an account. This online video editor already has more than 7 million registered users, which speaks volumes about its capabilities. You can choose from a broad range of fully customizable video templates that are optimized for use on different social networks and save you time on performing the video editing tasks on your own.</p>
<p>Clipchamp features impressive stock audio and video libraries you can use to create soundtracks or as a source of complementary footage for your WebM videos. The free version of this online video editor only lets you export videos in 480p resolution and you cannot use the stock footage for free.</p>
<h4 id="2-WeVideo-1"><a href="#2-WeVideo-1" class="headerlink" title="2. WeVideo"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wevideo.com/" >WeVideo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, pricing options start at $4.99 per month</p>
<p>This video editing platform offers a broad range of video editing options, so you will have very little trouble turning your footage saved in WebM format into attention-grabbing videos. The video editing tools you will have at your disposal depending on the subscription model you purchase.</p>
<p>With the Free version of WeVideo, you will only have five minutes of publishing time, you won’t be able to export WebM videos in resolutions larger than 480p and each video you create is going to be watermarked. That is why you must opt for Power, Unlimited, Professional or Business subscription package if you want your WebM videos to really stand out on social media.</p>
<h4 id="3-Magisto-1"><a href="#3-Magisto-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Magisto"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.magisto.com/" >Magisto <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, pricing options start at $4.99</p>

In addition, you can choose from hundreds of customizable templates that can be used to promote a business or to create a Valentine’s Day video.</p>
<p>The duration of the videos you can create with Magisto depends on the subscription model you have, but even if you choose the most expensive version of Magisto you are still not going to be able to export videos that are longer than 10 minutes.</p>
<h4 id="4-Online-UniConverter-1"><a href="#4-Online-UniConverter-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Online UniConverter"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.media.io/video-editor.html" >Online UniConverter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, pricing options start at $2.95 per month</p>
<p>Online UniConverter can be used to convert, compress or edit audio and video files for free, although your options are going to be limited if you opt for the free version of the web-based application. The free Video Editor enables you to perform basic video editing actions like trimming, cropping or rotating videos. In addition, you can adjust the Hue, Saturation or Brightness values of all WebM files you edit with Online UniConverter.</p>
<p>None of the videos you edit with this web-based video editor are going to be watermarked, but exporting videos in resolutions larger than 1080p isn’t an option.</p>
<h4 id="5-Aconvert-1"><a href="#5-Aconvert-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Aconvert"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aconvert.com/video/" >Aconvert <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p>Even though this is primarily a file conversion platform that enables you to change the format of images, PDF, audio or video files, you can also use Aconvert to edit your WebM videos. You can’t do much more other than cut, crop, rotate or merge video clips. In addition, you cannot upload video clips that are larger than 200MB to this platform which can make the video editing process difficult, since WebM videos can easily exceed this size limit.</p>
<p>Aconvert is far from being a perfect WebM video editor, but it still offers enough video editing options to enable you to create videos you can share online.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-Free-Desktop-WebM-Video-Editors-1"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-Free-Desktop-WebM-Video-Editors-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best Free Desktop WebM Video Editors"></a>Part 2: 5 Best Free Desktop WebM Video Editors</h2><p>Desktop-based video editing software products are commonly much more powerful than those that can only be used online, which makes <strong>editing WebM videos</strong> somewhat easier. Here are some of the best desktop WebM video editors you can use for free on Mac or PC computers.</p>
<h4 id="1-VSDC-1"><a href="#1-VSDC-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

<p>Editing WebM videos with VSDC isn’t any different than editing any other type of video since you just have to import a video into the editor, add it to the timeline and then remove all segments you don’t want to use. VSDC’s intuitive interface makes cutting, cropping or masking videos easy, as you can access any of these options with a single click. Moreover, the Video Stabilization tool enables you to turn shaky footage into perfectly smooth shots.</p>
<p>VSDC features a YouTube uploader and it lets you share your WebM videos to Facebook, Instagram or Vimeo. In addition, you can use this video editing software to change the format of your video files.</p>

<p>Besides being one of the most popular cross-platform media players ever created, VLC is also equipped with a set of video editing tools. In addition to converting WebM video files, you can also edit this type of file with VLC. This media player grants you access to a variety of filters, effects and color adjustment options you can use to polish your WebM videos.</p>
<p>Moreover, VLC lets you trim or crop each video you open with it so that you can remove the parts of the WebM videos you don’t want to share with your online audience. Even so, the process of editing a video with VLC can be too complicated for PC and Mac users who are not tech-savvy.</p>
