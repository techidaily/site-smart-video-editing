<h2 id="Part-1-Part-1-Typical-Aspect-Ratios-and-Sizes-of-Screens-and-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Part-1-Typical-Aspect-Ratios-and-Sizes-of-Screens-and-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Part 1: Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos"></a>Part 1 Part 1: Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos</h2><p>An aspect ratio is a measurement representing the ratio between the width and height of a screen or a video. It determines the length of your video or screen. Not only screens and videos, but you can use the concept also in images.</p>
<p>And, it is written as ‘x:y’ where ‘x’ is the width and ‘y’ is the height.</p>
<p>There isn’t any one-size-fits-all when we need to use the video aspect ratios. Aspect ratios are generally selected based on where the video will post, how it will be visible, and what aim it usually serves.</p>
<p>Videos utilized for social media will vary from trailers shows or movies shown in theaters. There are common aspect ratios for modern televisions, but broadcasters can consider using the aspect ratio that operates great with their audience and content.</p>
<p>Since most videos showcase through standard online video platforms, custom aspect ratios are not commonly used.</p>
<p>Here are a few standard aspect ratios that you can use for live streaming and other video creation:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-2.jpg"
                      alt="aspect ratios"
                ></p>
<p><strong>16:9</strong></p>
<p>A 16:9 aspect ratio represents a wide rectangle. It is also called “1.71:1,” the most accessible form of the ratio, mathematically speaking.</p>
<p>This ratio is mainly used in video creation and streaming and is considered the international standard format for cinema and television.</p>
<p>Many also tend to use this highly famous aspect ratio on their sites.</p>
<p>It is also more cost-effective to use screens compatible with this ratio instead of their predecessors. The standardization of computer monitors and televisions saved producers both the money and time spent in the research field.</p>
<p>One of the ideal resolutions you can use with a 16:9 aspect ratio is 4Kor 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels.</p>
<p><strong>1:1</strong></p>
<p>The 1:1 video aspect ratio is one of the ideal squares used with square television sets.</p>
<p>It is much less in demand but usually visible on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.</p>
<p>Many cameras still have a square setting even though it’s not the most commonly used aspect ratio.</p>
<p><strong>4:3</strong></p>
<p>The 4:3 aspect ratio was the general screen size for computer monitors and televisions before 16:9 and 16:10. The reason for the switch was the HDTV birth. It’s because the 16:9 and 16:10 aspect ratios allow for better resolutions than 4:3 do.</p>
<p>This aspect ratio was still considered for Apple iPads until they released the 2018 iPad Pro.</p>
<p><strong>3:2</strong></p>
<p>The 3:2 aspect ratio was primarily seen in classic 35 mm still photography still used on tablets, laptops, and various game consoles in the handheld form.</p>
<p>Many micro- to medium-sized cameras still use the 3:2 aspect ratio settings, but broadcasters rarely use it today.</p>
<p><strong>21:9</strong></p>
<p>The 21:9 aspect ratios have a pretty specific purpose. It is often called cinematic widescreen or ultra-widescreen.</p>
<p>It is also helpful for films with an anamorphic format. Anamorphic format videos create an optical illusion that offers a 360-degree view.</p>
<p>You are likely to look for the videos with this aspect ratio in notable museums, theme parks, theaters, and the like.</p>
<p><strong>9:16</strong></p>

It determines the length of your video or screen. Not only screens and videos, but you can use the concept also in images.</p>
<p>And, it is written as ‘x:y’ where ‘x’ is the width and ‘y’ is the height.</p>
<p>There isn’t any one-size-fits-all when we need to use the video aspect ratios. Aspect ratios are generally selected based on where the video will post, how it will be visible, and what aim it usually serves.</p>
<p>Videos utilized for social media will vary from trailers shows or movies shown in theaters. There are common aspect ratios for modern televisions, but broadcasters can consider using the aspect ratio that operates great with their audience and content.</p>
<p>Since most videos showcase through standard online video platforms, custom aspect ratios are not commonly used.</p>
<p>Here are a few standard aspect ratios that you can use for live streaming and other video creation:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="aspect ratios"
                ></p>
<p><strong>16:9</strong></p>
<p>A 16:9 aspect ratio represents a wide rectangle. It is also called “1.71:1,” the most accessible form of the ratio, mathematically speaking.</p>
<p>This ratio is mainly used in video creation and streaming and is considered the international standard format for cinema and television.</p>
<p>Many also tend to use this highly famous aspect ratio on their sites.</p>
<p>It is also more cost-effective to use screens compatible with this ratio instead of their predecessors. The standardization of computer monitors and televisions saved producers both the money and time spent in the research field.</p>
<p>One of the ideal resolutions you can use with a 16:9 aspect ratio is 4Kor 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels.</p>
<p><strong>1:1</strong></p>
<p>The 1:1 video aspect ratio is one of the ideal squares used with square television sets.</p>
<p>It is much less in demand but usually visible on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.</p>
<p>Many cameras still have a square setting even though it’s not the most commonly used aspect ratio.</p>
<p><strong>4:3</strong></p>
<p>The 4:3 aspect ratio was the general screen size for computer monitors and televisions before 16:9 and 16:10. The reason for the switch was the HDTV birth. It’s because the 16:9 and 16:10 aspect ratios allow for better resolutions than 4:3 do.</p>
<p>This aspect ratio was still considered for Apple iPads until they released the 2018 iPad Pro.</p>
<p><strong>3:2</strong></p>
<p>The 3:2 aspect ratio was primarily seen in classic 35 mm still photography still used on tablets, laptops, and various game consoles in the handheld form.</p>
<p>Many micro- to medium-sized cameras still use the 3:2 aspect ratio settings, but broadcasters rarely use it today.</p>
<p><strong>21:9</strong></p>
<p>The 21:9 aspect ratios have a pretty specific purpose. It is often called cinematic widescreen or ultra-widescreen.</p>
<p>It is also helpful for films with an anamorphic format. Anamorphic format videos create an optical illusion that offers a 360-degree view.</p>
<p>You are likely to look for the videos with this aspect ratio in notable museums, theme parks, theaters, and the like.</p>
<p><strong>9:16</strong></p>
<p>A 9:16 aspect ratio is for tall videos. This aspect ratio became famous after the launch of smartphones with video capabilities.</p>
<p>For instance, the optimal measure for an Instagram story is 1080 px by 1920 px, and thus its ratio comes out as 9:16. The same goes for other famous apps with “story” features, including Snapchat and Facebook.</p>
<p>This makes sense because the iPhone camera’s video setting can record footage in both 16:9 and 9:16.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Part-1-Typical-Aspect-Ratios-and-Sizes-of-Screens-and-Videos-2"><a href="#Part-1-Part-1-Typical-Aspect-Ratios-and-Sizes-of-Screens-and-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Part 1: Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos"></a>Part 1 Part 1: Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos</h2><p>An aspect ratio is a measurement representing the ratio between the width and height of a screen or a video. It determines the length of your video or screen. Not only screens and videos, but you can use the concept also in images.</p>
<p>And, it is written as ‘x:y’ where ‘x’ is the width and ‘y’ is the height.</p>
<p>There isn’t any one-size-fits-all when we need to use the video aspect ratios. Aspect ratios are generally selected based on where the video will post, how it will be visible, and what aim it usually serves.</p>
<p>Videos utilized for social media will vary from trailers shows or movies shown in theaters. There are common aspect ratios for modern televisions, but broadcasters can consider using the aspect ratio that operates great with their audience and content.</p>
<p>Since most videos showcase through standard online video platforms, custom aspect ratios are not commonly used.</p>
<p>Here are a few standard aspect ratios that you can use for live streaming and other video creation:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-2.jpg"
                      alt="aspect ratios"
                ></p>
<p><strong>16:9</strong></p>
<p>A 16:9 aspect ratio represents a wide rectangle. It is also called “1.71:1,” the most accessible form of the ratio, mathematically speaking.</p>
<p>This ratio is mainly used in video creation and streaming and is considered the international standard format for cinema and television.</p>
<p>Many also tend to use this highly famous aspect ratio on their sites.</p>
<p>It is also more cost-effective to use screens compatible with this ratio instead of their predecessors. The standardization of computer monitors and televisions saved producers both the money and time spent in the research field.</p>
<p>One of the ideal resolutions you can use with a 16:9 aspect ratio is 4Kor 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels.</p>
<p><strong>1:1</strong></p>
<p>The 1:1 video aspect ratio is one of the ideal squares used with square television sets.</p>
<p>It is much less in demand but usually visible on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.</p>
<p>Many cameras still have a square setting even though it’s not the most commonly used aspect ratio.</p>
<p><strong>4:3</strong></p>
<p>The 4:3 aspect ratio was the general screen size for computer monitors and televisions before 16:9 and 16:10. The reason for the switch was the HDTV birth. It’s because the 16:9 and 16:10 aspect ratios allow for better resolutions than 4:3 do.</p>
<p>This aspect ratio was still considered for Apple iPads until they released the 2018 iPad Pro.</p>
<p><strong>3:2</strong></p>
<p>The 3:2 aspect ratio was primarily seen in classic 35 mm still photography still used on tablets, laptops, and various game consoles in the handheld form.</p>
<p>Many micro- to medium-sized cameras still use the 3:2 aspect ratio settings, but broadcasters rarely use it today.</p>
<p><strong>21:9</strong></p>
<p>The 21:9 aspect ratios have a pretty specific purpose. It is often called cinematic widescreen or ultra-widescreen.</p>
<p>It is also helpful for films with an anamorphic format. Anamorphic format videos create an optical illusion that offers a 360-degree view.</p>
<p>You are likely to look for the videos with this aspect ratio in notable museums, theme parks, theaters, and the like.</p>
<p><strong>9:16</strong></p>
<p>A 9:16 aspect ratio is for tall videos. This aspect ratio became famous after the launch of smartphones with video capabilities.</p>
<p>For instance, the optimal measure for an Instagram story is 1080 px by 1920 px, and thus its ratio comes out as 9:16. The same goes for other famous apps with “story” features, including Snapchat and Facebook.</p>
<p>This makes sense because the iPhone camera’s video setting can record footage in both 16:9 and 9:16.</p>

                      alt="aspect ratios"
                ></p>
<p>Most cameras with video capabilities are available with various aspect ratio settings. This helps you decide which aspect ratio you’d like your video to have before recording it.</p>
<p>If you are looking to determine the aspect ratio of a video already shot, you can easily access additional information for the file.</p>
<p>The information button is a small “i” in a circle on Mac. Move on to right-click a file and select “<strong>Properties</strong>“ on your PC.</p>
<p>It may give you the actual width and height of the video, but you can divide the two to find the aspect ratio.</p>
<p>However, you don’t need to hassle as we’ll enlist the best five <strong>aspect ratio</strong> <strong>calculators online</strong> below.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Part-1-Typical-Aspect-Ratios-and-Sizes-of-Screens-and-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-1-Part-1-Typical-Aspect-Ratios-and-Sizes-of-Screens-and-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Part 1: Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos"></a>Part 1 Part 1: Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos</h2><p>An aspect ratio is a measurement representing the ratio between the width and height of a screen or a video. It determines the length of your video or screen. Not only screens and videos, but you can use the concept also in images.</p>
<p>And, it is written as ‘x:y’ where ‘x’ is the width and ‘y’ is the height.</p>
<p>There isn’t any one-size-fits-all when we need to use the video aspect ratios. Aspect ratios are generally selected based on where the video will post, how it will be visible, and what aim it usually serves.</p>
<p>Videos utilized for social media will vary from trailers shows or movies shown in theaters. There are common aspect ratios for modern televisions, but broadcasters can consider using the aspect ratio that operates great with their audience and content.</p>
<p>Since most videos showcase through standard online video platforms, custom aspect ratios are not commonly used.</p>
<p>Here are a few standard aspect ratios that you can use for live streaming and other video creation:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-2.jpg"
                      alt="aspect ratios"
                ></p>
<p><strong>16:9</strong></p>
<p>A 16:9 aspect ratio represents a wide rectangle. It is also called “1.71:1,” the most accessible form of the ratio, mathematically speaking.</p>
<p>This ratio is mainly used in video creation and streaming and is considered the international standard format for cinema and television.</p>
<p>Many also tend to use this highly famous aspect ratio on their sites.</p>
<p>It is also more cost-effective to use screens compatible with this ratio instead of their predecessors. The standardization of computer monitors and televisions saved producers both the money and time spent in the research field.</p>
<p>One of the ideal resolutions you can use with a 16:9 aspect ratio is 4Kor 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels.</p>
<p><strong>1:1</strong></p>
<p>The 1:1 video aspect ratio is one of the ideal squares used with square television sets.</p>
<p>It is much less in demand but usually visible on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.</p>
<p>Many cameras still have a square setting even though it’s not the most commonly used aspect ratio.</p>
<p><strong>4:3</strong></p>
<p>The 4:3 aspect ratio was the general screen size for computer monitors and televisions before 16:9 and 16:10. The reason for the switch was the HDTV birth. It’s because the 16:9 and 16:10 aspect ratios allow for better resolutions than 4:3 do.</p>
<p>This aspect ratio was still considered for Apple iPads until they released the 2018 iPad Pro.</p>
<p><strong>3:2</strong></p>
<p>The 3:2 aspect ratio was primarily seen in classic 35 mm still photography still used on tablets, laptops, and various game consoles in the handheld form.</p>
<p>Many micro- to medium-sized cameras still use the 3:2 aspect ratio settings, but broadcasters rarely use it today.</p>
<p><strong>21:9</strong></p>
<p>The 21:9 aspect ratios have a pretty specific purpose. It is often called cinematic widescreen or ultra-widescreen.</p>
<p>It is also helpful for films with an anamorphic format. Anamorphic format videos create an optical illusion that offers a 360-degree view.</p>
<p>You are likely to look for the videos with this aspect ratio in notable museums, theme parks, theaters, and the like.</p>
<p><strong>9:16</strong></p>
<p>A 9:16 aspect ratio is for tall videos. This aspect ratio became famous after the launch of smartphones with video capabilities.</p>
<p>For instance, the optimal measure for an Instagram story is 1080 px by 1920 px, and thus its ratio comes out as 9:16. The same goes for other famous apps with “story” features, including Snapchat and Facebook.</p>
<p>This makes sense because the iPhone camera’s video setting can record footage in both 16:9 and 9:16.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-Know-the-Aspect-Ratio-of-My-Video-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-Know-the-Aspect-Ratio-of-My-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do I Know the Aspect Ratio of My Video?"></a>Part 2 How Do I Know the Aspect Ratio of My Video?</h2><p><img

                      alt="aspect ratios"
                ></p>
<p>Most cameras with video capabilities are available with various aspect ratio settings. This helps you decide which aspect ratio you’d like your video to have before recording it.</p>
<p>If you are looking to determine the aspect ratio of a video already shot, you can easily access additional information for the file.</p>
<p>The information button is a small “i” in a circle on Mac. Move on to right-click a file and select “<strong>Properties</strong>“ on your PC.</p>
<p>It may give you the actual width and height of the video, but you can divide the two to find the aspect ratio.</p>
<p>However, you don’t need to hassle as we’ll enlist the best five <strong>aspect ratio</strong> <strong>calculators online</strong> below.</p>
<h3 id="01Calculate-Aspect-Ratio-3"><a href="#01Calculate-Aspect-Ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="01Calculate Aspect Ratio"></a>01Calculate Aspect Ratio</h3><p><img

<p>Life Lapse is probably one of the best stop motion apps ever created because it offers all the tools you need to shoot and edit a stop motion animation. Focus, white balance and exposure lock, ghosted image overlay or interval timers are just a few among countless options you can use while shooting a stop motion video. Optionally, you can import photos and use the app’s video editing tools to adjust frame rates, apply visual effects or create soundtracks from royalty-free songs. Life Lapse grants you access to color correction tools, which enables you to set saturation, brightness, contrast or white balance values manually for each frame you include in the stop motion video you are making. You must upgrade to the app’s pro version if you want to record footage in 4K resolution, import audio files to your projects or export videos without a watermark.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a simple app that lets you take image sequences with ease, you shouldn’t look much further than Frameographer. You can choose if you want record stop motion videos with iPhone’s front or rear cameras in 1080p or 720p resolutions. Additionally, you can enable or disable a grid that helps you compose shots or lock the focus and exposure. Frameographer also features a low-light Boost mode, which enables you to make stop motion or time lapse videos under low light conditions. The app lets you add new frames to projects you already created so that you don’t have to complete all the work on a stop motion video at once. Frameographer lets you use songs from your iTunes music library, but the lack of video editing features makes this app a relatively poor choice for video content creators who want to edit their footage quickly before posting it on social media.</p>

<p>This app offers only a standard set of stop motion tools, such as onion skin or instant playback, which makes it largely overpriced as it fails to offer any of the advanced stop motion photography options. What’s more, you have to install an additional app if you want to snap photos remotely and you won’t have access to any photo editing options. Rearranging the frames you add to the timeline isn’t possible and the app doesn’t even have the undo option. The app offers audio recording features, which enables you to create voiceovers for your videos, and you can import audio files you would like to include in your soundtrack. Even so, iStopMotion is far from being a perfect stop motion app, as there are many better options you can find on App Store.</p>

Moreover, you should consider getting the accessories for your Smartphone that will make shooting a stop motion video easier.

<p>This cross-platform app is equipped with a versatile set of stop motion animation tools that grant you complete control over all camera settings. You can adjust the white balance, ISO, and exposure manually, while the app also allows you to choose if you want to use manual or auto focus. Furthermore, Stop Motion Studio offers animation guides that enable its users to move the objects in the shot with more precision, while the app’s timeline makes it easy to navigate through large numbers of frames. Changing backgrounds, applying visual effects or creating soundtracks are just a few among numerous options Stop Motion Studio offers. Apple Watch can be used as a remote shutter release on the iOS version of the app, and you can also pair it with all DSLR cameras that have WiFi. Even though installing Stop Motion Studio on an iPhone, iPad or an Android Smartphone won’t cost you anything, you must make in-app purchases if you want to export your projects in 4K resolution or import images into the app.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Clayframes wasn’t updated in years, it is still one of the best stop motion apps for Android Smartphones. You can either capture new footage or import the images you want to use in your stop motion video, and arrange them in any way you want. The app’s erase tool allows you to remove rigs and all other objects you don’t want to keep in the shot. Clayframes is equipped with timed shutter release options that enable you to choose how frequently the app is going to take photos. Optionally, you can draw over the photos you take with Clayframes, and preview your footage at different frame rates without having to export it. Once you’re done making a stop motion animation, you can choose the resolution in which the video is going to be exported and decide if you want to share the video you created to Facebook or YouTube directly from the app.</p>

<p>Inexperienced photographers who are still learning how to make stop motion animations should consider installing PicPac Stop Motion &amp; Time Lapse on their Android phones. The features this app offers may not be the most powerful, but you can still use them to create a smooth stop motion animation. The app’s Timelapse-manual mode enables you to take a new photo each time you make a loud noise and you can also record voiceovers or create soundtracks for your videos with PicPac. The app lets you share all of your creations on YouTube, but only if you are signed in to your account. Furthermore, the free version of PicPac watermarks all your videos and it doesn’t allow you to export videos in resolutions larger than 360p. That’s why you must upgrade to the pro version of the app if you want to create stop motion animations with it on a constant basis.</p>

<p>iPhone and iPad owners who would like to create time lapse and stop motion videos from the same app can try using iMotion. The app has Time-Lapse, Manual, WiFi Remote and Photo Library Import modes, and you can easily choose the one that best meets the demands of your project. What’s more, iMotion lets you decide if you want to capture footage with a front or rear camera and it allows you to control focus, exposure or white balance manually. The maximum duration of a stop motion movie is not limited, and you can also preview your projects at different frame rates. All projects you create with iMotion can be exported in 4K, 1080p or 720p resolutions, although shooting in 4K is only possible on newer versions of iPhones and iPads. The free version of iMotion offers only a limited range of options, and you must purchase the full version of the app if you want to use all the tools it has to offer</p>

<p>Making a stop motion video with this app is a straightforward process that can be completed in just a few easy steps. After you launch the app and tap on the Create button, the device’s camera will open and you just have to press the camera button each time you want to make a new frame. Tap on the Done button once you complete the sequence of images, so you just have to preview the result before proceeding to export the video. The app doesn’t allow you to record voiceovers or create soundtracks, and you must use another video editing app for iOS devices if you want to edit a stop motion video further. It is worth noting that you must give Stop Motion Maker access to your phone’s camera and photo library in order for it to function properly.</p>

<p>There are a lot of different types of stop motion animations, and you must make sure that the app you install on your Smartphone has all the tools you need to make the video you want. Moreover, you should consider getting the accessories for your Smartphone that will make shooting a stop motion video easier.

<p><strong>User Ratings:</strong>  4.5 on App Store, 3.8 on Google Play</p>
<p>This cross-platform app is equipped with a versatile set of stop motion animation tools that grant you complete control over all camera settings. You can adjust the white balance, ISO, and exposure manually, while the app also allows you to choose if you want to use manual or auto focus. Furthermore, Stop Motion Studio offers animation guides that enable its users to move the objects in the shot with more precision, while the app’s timeline makes it easy to navigate through large numbers of frames. Changing backgrounds, applying visual effects or creating soundtracks are just a few among numerous options Stop Motion Studio offers. Apple Watch can be used as a remote shutter release on the iOS version of the app, and you can also pair it with all DSLR cameras that have WiFi. Even though installing Stop Motion Studio on an iPhone, iPad or an Android Smartphone won’t cost you anything, you must make in-app purchases if you want to export your projects in 4K resolution or import images into the app.</p>
<h3 id="2-Clayframes-2"><a href="#2-Clayframes-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Clayframes"></a>2. Clayframes</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong>  $2.28</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Clayframes wasn’t updated in years, it is still one of the best stop motion apps for Android Smartphones. You can either capture new footage or import the images you want to use in your stop motion video, and arrange them in any way you want. The app’s erase tool allows you to remove rigs and all other objects you don’t want to keep in the shot. Clayframes is equipped with timed shutter release options that enable you to choose how frequently the app is going to take photos. Optionally, you can draw over the photos you take with Clayframes, and preview your footage at different frame rates without having to export it. Once you’re done making a stop motion animation, you can choose the resolution in which the video is going to be exported and decide if you want to share the video you created to Facebook or YouTube directly from the app.</p>

<p>Inexperienced photographers who are still learning how to make stop motion animations should consider installing PicPac Stop Motion &amp; Time Lapse on their Android phones. The features this app offers may not be the most powerful, but you can still use them to create a smooth stop motion animation. The app’s Timelapse-manual mode enables you to take a new photo each time you make a loud noise and you can also record voiceovers or create soundtracks for your videos with PicPac. The app lets you share all of your creations on YouTube, but only if you are signed in to your account. Furthermore, the free version of PicPac watermarks all your videos and it doesn’t allow you to export videos in resolutions larger than 360p. That’s why you must upgrade to the pro version of the app if you want to create stop motion animations with it on a constant basis.</p>
<h3 id="4-iMotion-2"><a href="#4-iMotion-2" class="headerlink" title="4. iMotion"></a>4. iMotion</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong>  Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>

<p><strong>User Ratings:</strong>  4.4</p>
<p>iPhone and iPad owners who would like to create time lapse and stop motion videos from the same app can try using iMotion. The app has Time-Lapse, Manual, WiFi Remote and Photo Library Import modes, and you can easily choose the one that best meets the demands of your project. What’s more, iMotion lets you decide if you want to capture footage with a front or rear camera and it allows you to control focus, exposure or white balance manually. The maximum duration of a stop motion movie is not limited, and you can also preview your projects at different frame rates. All projects you create with iMotion can be exported in 4K, 1080p or 720p resolutions, although shooting in 4K is only possible on newer versions of iPhones and iPads. The free version of iMotion offers only a limited range of options, and you must purchase the full version of the app if you want to use all the tools it has to offer</p>

<p>Making a stop motion video with this app is a straightforward process that can be completed in just a few easy steps. After you launch the app and tap on the Create button, the device’s camera will open and you just have to press the camera button each time you want to make a new frame. Tap on the Done button once you complete the sequence of images, so you just have to preview the result before proceeding to export the video. The app doesn’t allow you to record voiceovers or create soundtracks, and you must use another video editing app for iOS devices if you want to edit a stop motion video further. It is worth noting that you must give Stop Motion Maker access to your phone’s camera and photo library in order for it to function properly.</p>

<p>This is a must-have app for all passionate Minecraft players, as it allows them to create stop motion animations that feature all of their favorite characters. After you’ve created your Minecraft world, you can start capturing it with Stop Motion Movie Creator. The app is equipped with an onion skin tool and guides that show you how to move the objects on the screen which makes the process of creating a stop motion animation much easier. In addition, you can apply a variety of visual effects to all images you take with this app or even add the end credits to the video. Stop Motion Movie Creator grants you access to the music and sound effects from the video game, which enables you to create perfect soundtracks for the videos you make with this app. The best part is that you don’t have to create Minecraft-inspired stop motion animations since the app enables you to make videos using clay figures or Lego bricks.</p>

<p><strong>User Ratings:</strong>  4.8 on App Store, 3.6 on Google Play</p>
<p>Life Lapse is probably one of the best stop motion apps ever created because it offers all the tools you need to shoot and edit a stop motion animation. Focus, white balance and exposure lock, ghosted image overlay or interval timers are just a few among countless options you can use while shooting a stop motion video. Optionally, you can import photos and use the app’s video editing tools to adjust frame rates, apply visual effects or create soundtracks from royalty-free songs. Life Lapse grants you access to color correction tools, which enables you to set saturation, brightness, contrast or white balance values manually for each frame you include in the stop motion video you are making. You must upgrade to the app’s pro version if you want to record footage in 4K resolution, import audio files to your projects or export videos without a watermark.</p>
<h3 id="8-Frameographer-2"><a href="#8-Frameographer-2" class="headerlink" title="8. Frameographer"></a>8. Frameographer</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong>  $4.99</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/frameographer-stop-motion/id503347879" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p><strong>User Ratings:</strong>  3.4</p>
<p>If you are looking for a simple app that lets you take image sequences with ease, you shouldn’t look much further than Frameographer. You can choose if you want record stop motion videos with iPhone’s front or rear cameras in 1080p or 720p resolutions. Additionally, you can enable or disable a grid that helps you compose shots or lock the focus and exposure. Frameographer also features a low-light Boost mode, which enables you to make stop motion or time lapse videos under low light conditions. The app lets you add new frames to projects you already created so that you don’t have to complete all the work on a stop motion video at once. Frameographer lets you use songs from your iTunes music library, but the lack of video editing features makes this app a relatively poor choice for video content creators who want to edit their footage quickly before posting it on social media.</p>
<h3 id="9-Osnap-Pro-2"><a href="#9-Osnap-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="9. Osnap! Pro"></a>9. Osnap! Pro</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong>  $4.99, offers in-app purchases</p>

<p><strong>User Ratings:</strong>  4.7</p>
<p>Photographers who like shooting time-lapses and stop motion videos with their iPhones can benefit from installing Osnap! Pro on their devices. Besides offering presets that enable you to complete projects quickly, this app is also equipped with features you need to control camera settings manually. Osnap! Pro lets you shoot in 4K or Full HD resolutions, and you can choose if you want to create a vertically or horizontally oriented video or set an aspect ratio that best fits your project. The app allows you to trigger the photo capture feature using loud sounds and even set reminders that notify you when you are supposed to take a new photo. However, if you want to import photos from your device, record voiceovers or transfer footage via WiFi you must make in-app purchases.</p>
<h3 id="10-iStopMotion-2"><a href="#10-iStopMotion-2" class="headerlink" title="10. iStopMotion"></a>10. iStopMotion</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong>  $9.99</p>

<p><strong>User Ratings:</strong>  3.7</p>
<p>This app offers only a standard set of stop motion tools, such as onion skin or instant playback, which makes it largely overpriced as it fails to offer any of the advanced stop motion photography options. What’s more, you have to install an additional app if you want to snap photos remotely and you won’t have access to any photo editing options. Rearranging the frames you add to the timeline isn’t possible and the app doesn’t even have the undo option. The app offers audio recording features, which enables you to create voiceovers for your videos, and you can import audio files you would like to include in your soundtrack. Even so, iStopMotion is far from being a perfect stop motion app, as there are many better options you can find on App Store.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Recording and editing stop motion animations from Smartphones and tablets has never been easier. Each app for iOS and Android devices we included in this article grants you access to all the tools you’re going to need during the process of making a stop motion animation.

You can adjust the white balance, ISO, and exposure manually, while the app also allows you to choose if you want to use manual or auto focus.

Changing backgrounds, applying visual effects or creating soundtracks are just a few among numerous options Stop Motion Studio offers. Apple Watch can be used as a remote shutter release on the iOS version of the app, and you can also pair it with all DSLR cameras that have WiFi. Even though installing Stop Motion Studio on an iPhone, iPad or an Android Smartphone won’t cost you anything, you must make in-app purchases if you want to export your projects in 4K resolution or import images into the app.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Clayframes wasn’t updated in years, it is still one of the best stop motion apps for Android Smartphones. You can either capture new footage or import the images you want to use in your stop motion video, and arrange them in any way you want. The app’s erase tool allows you to remove rigs and all other objects you don’t want to keep in the shot. Clayframes is equipped with timed shutter release options that enable you to choose how frequently the app is going to take photos. Optionally, you can draw over the photos you take with Clayframes, and preview your footage at different frame rates without having to export it. Once you’re done making a stop motion animation, you can choose the resolution in which the video is going to be exported and decide if you want to share the video you created to Facebook or YouTube directly from the app.</p>

<p>Inexperienced photographers who are still learning how to make stop motion animations should consider installing PicPac Stop Motion &amp; Time Lapse on their Android phones. The features this app offers may not be the most powerful, but you can still use them to create a smooth stop motion animation. The app’s Timelapse-manual mode enables you to take a new photo each time you make a loud noise and you can also record voiceovers or create soundtracks for your videos with PicPac. The app lets you share all of your creations on YouTube, but only if you are signed in to your account. Furthermore, the free version of PicPac watermarks all your videos and it doesn’t allow you to export videos in resolutions larger than 360p. That’s why you must upgrade to the pro version of the app if you want to create stop motion animations with it on a constant basis.</p>

<p>iPhone and iPad owners who would like to create time lapse and stop motion videos from the same app can try using iMotion. The app has Time-Lapse, Manual, WiFi Remote and Photo Library Import modes, and you can easily choose the one that best meets the demands of your project. What’s more, iMotion lets you decide if you want to capture footage with a front or rear camera and it allows you to control focus, exposure or white balance manually. The maximum duration of a stop motion movie is not limited, and you can also preview your projects at different frame rates. All projects you create with iMotion can be exported in 4K, 1080p or 720p resolutions, although shooting in 4K is only possible on newer versions of iPhones and iPads. The free version of iMotion offers only a limited range of options, and you must purchase the full version of the app if you want to use all the tools it has to offer</p>

<p>Making a stop motion video with this app is a straightforward process that can be completed in just a few easy steps. After you launch the app and tap on the Create button, the device’s camera will open and you just have to press the camera button each time you want to make a new frame. Tap on the Done button once you complete the sequence of images, so you just have to preview the result before proceeding to export the video. The app doesn’t allow you to record voiceovers or create soundtracks, and you must use another video editing app for iOS devices if you want to edit a stop motion video further. It is worth noting that you must give Stop Motion Maker access to your phone’s camera and photo library in order for it to function properly.</p>

After you’ve created your Minecraft world, you can start capturing it with Stop Motion Movie Creator. The app is equipped with an onion skin tool and guides that show you how to move the objects on the screen which makes the process of creating a stop motion animation much easier. In addition, you can apply a variety of visual effects to all images you take with this app or even add the end credits to the video. Stop Motion Movie Creator grants you access to the music and sound effects from the video game, which enables you to create perfect soundtracks for the videos you make with this app. The best part is that you don’t have to create Minecraft-inspired stop motion animations since the app enables you to make videos using clay figures or Lego bricks.</p>

<p>Life Lapse is probably one of the best stop motion apps ever created because it offers all the tools you need to shoot and edit a stop motion animation. Focus, white balance and exposure lock, ghosted image overlay or interval timers are just a few among countless options you can use while shooting a stop motion video. Optionally, you can import photos and use the app’s video editing tools to adjust frame rates, apply visual effects or create soundtracks from royalty-free songs. Life Lapse grants you access to color correction tools, which enables you to set saturation, brightness, contrast or white balance values manually for each frame you include in the stop motion video you are making. You must upgrade to the app’s pro version if you want to record footage in 4K resolution, import audio files to your projects or export videos without a watermark.</p>
<h3 id="8-Frameographer-3"><a href="#8-Frameographer-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Frameographer"></a>8. Frameographer</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong>  $4.99</p>

<p>If you are looking for a simple app that lets you take image sequences with ease, you shouldn’t look much further than Frameographer. You can choose if you want record stop motion videos with iPhone’s front or rear cameras in 1080p or 720p resolutions. Additionally, you can enable or disable a grid that helps you compose shots or lock the focus and exposure. Frameographer also features a low-light Boost mode, which enables you to make stop motion or time lapse videos under low light conditions. The app lets you add new frames to projects you already created so that you don’t have to complete all the work on a stop motion video at once. Frameographer lets you use songs from your iTunes music library, but the lack of video editing features makes this app a relatively poor choice for video content creators who want to edit their footage quickly before posting it on social media.</p>

<p>Photographers who like shooting time-lapses and stop motion videos with their iPhones can benefit from installing Osnap! Pro on their devices. Besides offering presets that enable you to complete projects quickly, this app is also equipped with features you need to control camera settings manually. Osnap! Pro lets you shoot in 4K or Full HD resolutions, and you can choose if you want to create a vertically or horizontally oriented video or set an aspect ratio that best fits your project. The app allows you to trigger the photo capture feature using loud sounds and even set reminders that notify you when you are supposed to take a new photo. However, if you want to import photos from your device, record voiceovers or transfer footage via WiFi you must make in-app purchases.</p>

<p><strong>User Ratings:</strong>  3.7</p>
<p>This app offers only a standard set of stop motion tools, such as onion skin or instant playback, which makes it largely overpriced as it fails to offer any of the advanced stop motion photography options. What’s more, you have to install an additional app if you want to snap photos remotely and you won’t have access to any photo editing options. Rearranging the frames you add to the timeline isn’t possible and the app doesn’t even have the undo option. The app offers audio recording features, which enables you to create voiceovers for your videos, and you can import audio files you would like to include in your soundtrack. Even so, iStopMotion is far from being a perfect stop motion app, as there are many better options you can find on App Store.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Recording and editing stop motion animations from Smartphones and tablets has never been easier.

<p>The videos you record with your phone often don’t last very long, which makes it a bit difficult to tell the entire story of the scene you captured. Fortunately, there are more than a few simple ways to combine and merge multiple clips, that don’t involve using professional video editing apps. So even if you are a newcomer to the world of video content production you won’t have any trouble creating social media videos. That’s why in this article we are going to present to you some of the best online platforms that enable you to merge your video clips effortlessly.</p>

In addition, the platform’s processing ability as well as the export options can have a significant impact on the quality of the video you’ll be able to produce. Here are the five best online video mergers you can use to create your social media videos in 2022.</p>
<h4 id="1-Merge-Video"><a href="#1-Merge-Video" class="headerlink" title="1. Merge Video"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mergevideo.online/" >Merge Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This video editing platform allows you to do much more than just arrange and merge video clips, because it offers tools that enable you to resize, crop or rotate videos, adjust the colors in the footage you upload to the platform or cut and merge audio files. The process of combining multiple clips with this online tool can be completed in three simple steps, as you just have to upload the files you want to edit either from a hard drive or the cloud, rearrange them by dragging and dropping each video clip to a specific location on the timeline and choosing the format in which the file is going to be exported. You can opt to save the final cut of your video to your computer or to store it on Google Drive or Dropbox.</p>
<h4 id="3-Aconvert"><a href="#3-Aconvert" class="headerlink" title="3. Aconvert"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aconvert.com/video/merge/" >Aconvert <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Even though this website is mostly dedicated to the conversion of different types of files, you can also use it to merge, cut, crop or rotate video files. Aconvert supports nearly all commonly used video file formats, so you can upload and merge mp4, flv, mov or avi files among numerous others. The maximum size of a video clip you can upload to this platform can’t exceed 1GB and you need to make sure that all files you want to merge have the same frame rate and format. Once you click the Submit button, you won’t be able to rearrange your video files, which is why you have to upload video clips in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the output video. After the merging process is completed, you will be able to save the result on Dropbox, Google Drive or your Smartphone via a QR code.</p>
<h4 id="4-Kapwing"><a href="#4-Kapwing" class="headerlink" title="4. Kapwing"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kapwing.com/maker/editor" >Kapwing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="kapwing_1"
                ></p>
<p>The wide range of video editing tools that the Kapwing offers makes it one of the best online video editors. You can use Kapwing to make video montages, crop videos, rotate them or perform any other basic video editing action without even having an account on the platform. In order to start merging the video clips you just have to select the Video Maker option, upload video files from an online source or from your computer and arrange them in any way you want. The platform also lets you choose the aspect ratio of the output video which enables you to create vertical or square videos effortlessly. Simply click on the Create! button when you are ready to export the video, and wait for the new file to be generated. Afterward, you can proceed to download the video to your computer or save it to your iPhone, but keep in mind that all videos you create with the free version of Kapwing are going to be watermarked.</p>
<h4 id="5-Cellsea"><a href="#5-Cellsea" class="headerlink" title="5.

Its video editing tools enable you to cut, trim or resize videos, which makes it quite useful in case you want to polish your video before sharing it on social media. To start merging several video clips you just have to upload those files to Cellsea, but unfortunately, you can only upload files that are stored on your computer. When done, you can choose the output format of the video file and save it as mov, mp4, flv 3gp or avi file. The platform lets you download the results to your computer or you can choose to send them to your phone.</p>
<h4 id="6-FlexClip"><a href="#6-FlexClip" class="headerlink" title="6. FlexClip"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.flexclip.com/features/video-merger.html" >FlexClip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Before you can start piecing together your video clips with this online video editing tool, you must first create an account or use your Google and Facebook accounts to sign in. You can then create a new project and once the editing window loads you can start adding video clips to the storyboard. Besides enabling you to upload videos from your computer, FlexClip also offers a rich selection of stock footage you can use in your projects, but you must keep in mind that the platform won’t let you upload videos that are longer than one minute. You can change the position of the video clip by dragging it to a new location in the storyboard and you can also use FlexClip’s music library to add sound to your video. Hit the Export button after you’ve arranged the video clips in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the video and proceed to pick a 480p, 720p or 1080p output quality.</p>

You can opt to save the final cut of your video to your computer or to store it on Google Drive or Dropbox.</p>

After the merging process is completed, you will be able to save the result on Dropbox, Google Drive or your Smartphone via a QR code.</p>
