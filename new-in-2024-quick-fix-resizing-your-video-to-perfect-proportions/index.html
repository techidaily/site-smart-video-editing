For a certain aspect ratio, there is several counterparts’ resolution that can be used. While the aspect ratio defines the width and the height relationship, the resolution is the number of pixels on the screen.</p>
<p>To obtain the resolution of a video, you will multiply the height by the width while for the aspect ratio, width is divided by the height. When the height is multiplied by its width times, the results you get represent the square pixels of your screen and this number dented the quality of the video. The higher the pixels, the higher will be the video quality.</p>

<p> Adobe have recently released their new multi-platform video editing tool named <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html" >Adobe Rush <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It promises to be the first of its type in the world, allowing hassle video editing and publishing to a multitude of platforms.</p>

<p> Dubbed the video editing tool for the YouTube generation, having been designed from the ground up for online video creators. Editing is simple via its suite of audio and visual tools, including title screens, transition effects and color adjustment tools. Export is optimized for all social platforms available, including Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat.</p>
<p> Despite the promise of the perfect video editing tool, it’s not been entirely warmly received. Some complain that the editing tools are just too basic, others that the price is uncompetitive. Other issues have been raised with slow rendering capabilities and general instability of the platform, causing crashes that can set projects back by hours.</p>
<p> We’re going to take a look at some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush out there, which may be more capable of getting the job done.</p>

<p> Windows users will need to be upgraded to the latest version of the operating system, at least version 1709 as a minimum. You’ll also need at least 8GB of RAM if you want to avoid the system crashing every time you use it.</p>
<p> Despite having computers that meet the required spec, numerous users have complained that Adobe Rush is buggy and repeatedly crashes. Some say that the laggy performance makes it almost impossible to use.</p>
<p> An alternative is to use Rush on your iPhone, but for this you’ll need to own at least an iPhone 7, preferably something newer. In testing, we found it to be very slow, even on an iPhone X. If you’re an Android user, you’ll need to wait to experience the ‘Rush’, because this software is not available for your handset yet. Adobe have said they are working on it and how to have it ready at some point in 2019.</p>
<h4 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h4><p> As a video editing tool, it’s fairly competent, but for anything more than the basics, it’s somewhat lacking. Many of the most basic video editing tools are missing, and the platform supports only three transitions, so if you’re into making longer or more complex videos, its just not going to work.</p>
<p> In terms of rendering, we found it incredibly slow in comparison to some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush. The background music choices are pretty limited too, and most of it is not what you want accompanying your cutting-edge videos.</p>
<p> What really broke the deal for us was the inability to specify the output of your video files. This means that although social sharing could be OK, you’re going to be stuck if you want to share it in other locations. It’s great to see a video editing app on iPhone, but overall, it’s really nothing special.</p>
<h4 id="Price"><a href="#Price" class="headerlink" title="Price"></a>Price</h4><p> If you already subscribe to the Adobe Create Cloud (CC) suite, then Rush will be included in your subscription. However, if you want to subscribe to it as a standalone app, the price is $9.99 a month for individuals. This is not particularly competitive with the alternatives to Premier Rush, and could be prohibitively expensive for the hobbyist, which is, after all, the market Adobe are aiming at.</p>
<h2 id="Alternatives-to-Adobe-Rush-for-All-Platforms"><a href="#Alternatives-to-Adobe-Rush-for-All-Platforms" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to Adobe Rush for All Platforms"></a>Alternatives to Adobe Rush for All Platforms</h2><p> While Adobe are marketing Rush as a ‘cross platform’ video editor, there are alternatives to Premier Rush which do the job just as well, if not better, and often for a lot less.</p>
<p><strong>1. For Windows - Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p> We love <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as an alternative to Adobe Rush for Windows. Unlike Rush, you can pick and choose your video output format, as Filmora is compatible with all major video file types including mp4, FLV, MKV, AVI, MOV and more. Instead of being limited to a handful of basic effects, Filmora supports more than <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://effects.wondershare.com/" >300 high performance effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and filters to perfect your visual appeal.</p>

<p> As well as being a video editor, Filmora is a working audio editor too, featuring a full mixer and equalizer to bring your music and speech to life. There’re no transitional limitations, and you can even use green-screen technology, tilt-shift and jump cut features to make your videos pop.</p>

                ></p>
<p> Each video can use up to 99 timelines to make it easier to edit and customize your work. Finally, and a big plus for many of us, you don’t need to have the latest and best PC in order to use this software. Wondershare Filmora works on Windows 7, 8 and 10, and requires only 3GB of RAM. If you want to work in HD or 4K quality, however, you will need 8GB RAM.</p>
<p><strong>2. For Mac - iMovie</strong></p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a powerful editing tool designed for iOS and perfect to use on a Mac. Using your own photos and videos, you can create polished movies complete with titles and even a credits roll. It’s great for turning memories into beautiful keepsakes, which can then be shared with family and friends via social media or direct from your Apple device.</p>

<p> The user-friendly interface makes it possible for even the most novice of users to harness the power of digital video editing. Complete with templates and easy to use tools, even beginners can make high quality trailers, logos and cinema like productions.</p>
<p> iMovie lets users access a number of special effects and enhancements, as well as ten filters to improve the images. Music can be chosen from their own library, and narrative voice overs are possible too. We think iMovie is one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush available for Mac.</p>
<p><strong>3. For Android - Filmora</strong></p>
<p> As Rush is not yet available for the Android platform, users must look for alternatives to Premier Rush if they want to go ahead and start making movies. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great solution, as powerful as most of the desktop editors you’ll come across and with all the features you need to get started.</p>
<p> Clips can be selected from your own device, or from Facebook or Google, and then added into your project folder to be created into a movie. They can then be arranged into a handy timeline, using simple drag and drop functionality which is easy for even beginners to master. There are even in-built themes which you can try out to turn your home movies into something special.</p>
<p> For switching between stills or video clips, there are a raft of fun transitions available to make it a more cohesive production. You can adjust colors, brightness, speed and more, as well as adding in subtitles and editing in music. One of the best features of this software is the picture-in-picture function, where you can add another video or still over the main one. It’s free and amazing fun, and we think one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush for Android.</p>
<p><strong>4. For iOS - LumaFusion</strong></p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumafusion/id1062022008?mt=8" >LumaFusion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a powerful multi track video editor which has been built for the mobile marketplace. It’s widely used by professional filmmakers and journalists, which is why we’ve picked it as one of the best alternatives to Premier Rush for iOS users.</p>

<p> Windows users will need to be upgraded to the latest version of the operating system, at least version 1709 as a minimum. You’ll also need at least 8GB of RAM if you want to avoid the system crashing every time you use it.</p>
<p> Despite having computers that meet the required spec, numerous users have complained that Adobe Rush is buggy and repeatedly crashes. Some say that the laggy performance makes it almost impossible to use.</p>
<p> An alternative is to use Rush on your iPhone, but for this you’ll need to own at least an iPhone 7, preferably something newer. In testing, we found it to be very slow, even on an iPhone X. If you’re an Android user, you’ll need to wait to experience the ‘Rush’, because this software is not available for your handset yet. Adobe have said they are working on it and how to have it ready at some point in 2019.</p>
<h4 id="Performance-1"><a href="#Performance-1" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h4><p> As a video editing tool, it’s fairly competent, but for anything more than the basics, it’s somewhat lacking. Many of the most basic video editing tools are missing, and the platform supports only three transitions, so if you’re into making longer or more complex videos, its just not going to work.</p>
<p> In terms of rendering, we found it incredibly slow in comparison to some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush. The background music choices are pretty limited too, and most of it is not what you want accompanying your cutting-edge videos.</p>
<p> What really broke the deal for us was the inability to specify the output of your video files. This means that although social sharing could be OK, you’re going to be stuck if you want to share it in other locations. It’s great to see a video editing app on iPhone, but overall, it’s really nothing special.</p>
<h4 id="Price-1"><a href="#Price-1" class="headerlink" title="Price"></a>Price</h4><p> If you already subscribe to the Adobe Create Cloud (CC) suite, then Rush will be included in your subscription. However, if you want to subscribe to it as a standalone app, the price is $9.99 a month for individuals. This is not particularly competitive with the alternatives to Premier Rush, and could be prohibitively expensive for the hobbyist, which is, after all, the market Adobe are aiming at.</p>
<h2 id="Alternatives-to-Adobe-Rush-for-All-Platforms-1"><a href="#Alternatives-to-Adobe-Rush-for-All-Platforms-1" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to Adobe Rush for All Platforms"></a>Alternatives to Adobe Rush for All Platforms</h2><p> While Adobe are marketing Rush as a ‘cross platform’ video editor, there are alternatives to Premier Rush which do the job just as well, if not better, and often for a lot less.</p>
<p><strong>1. For Windows - Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p> We love <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as an alternative to Adobe Rush for Windows. Unlike Rush, you can pick and choose your video output format, as Filmora is compatible with all major video file types including mp4, FLV, MKV, AVI, MOV and more. Instead of being limited to a handful of basic effects, Filmora supports more than <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://effects.wondershare.com/" >300 high performance effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and filters to perfect your visual appeal.</p>

                      alt="Download Win Version"
                ></a><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p>
<p> As well as being a video editor, Filmora is a working audio editor too, featuring a full mixer and equalizer to bring your music and speech to life. There’re no transitional limitations, and you can even use green-screen technology, tilt-shift and jump cut features to make your videos pop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-rush-alternatives-filmora-9.jpg"
                     
                ></p>
<p> Each video can use up to 99 timelines to make it easier to edit and customize your work. Finally, and a big plus for many of us, you don’t need to have the latest and best PC in order to use this software. Wondershare Filmora works on Windows 7, 8 and 10, and requires only 3GB of RAM. If you want to work in HD or 4K quality, however, you will need 8GB RAM.</p>
<p><strong>2. For Mac - iMovie</strong></p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a powerful editing tool designed for iOS and perfect to use on a Mac. Using your own photos and videos, you can create polished movies complete with titles and even a credits roll. It’s great for turning memories into beautiful keepsakes, which can then be shared with family and friends via social media or direct from your Apple device.</p>

                ></p>
<p> The user-friendly interface makes it possible for even the most novice of users to harness the power of digital video editing. Complete with templates and easy to use tools, even beginners can make high quality trailers, logos and cinema like productions.</p>
<p> iMovie lets users access a number of special effects and enhancements, as well as ten filters to improve the images. Music can be chosen from their own library, and narrative voice overs are possible too. We think iMovie is one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush available for Mac.</p>
<p><strong>3. For Android - Filmora</strong></p>
<p> As Rush is not yet available for the Android platform, users must look for alternatives to Premier Rush if they want to go ahead and start making movies. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great solution, as powerful as most of the desktop editors you’ll come across and with all the features you need to get started.</p>
<p> Clips can be selected from your own device, or from Facebook or Google, and then added into your project folder to be created into a movie. They can then be arranged into a handy timeline, using simple drag and drop functionality which is easy for even beginners to master. There are even in-built themes which you can try out to turn your home movies into something special.</p>
<p> For switching between stills or video clips, there are a raft of fun transitions available to make it a more cohesive production. You can adjust colors, brightness, speed and more, as well as adding in subtitles and editing in music. One of the best features of this software is the picture-in-picture function, where you can add another video or still over the main one. It’s free and amazing fun, and we think one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush for Android.</p>
<p><strong>4. For iOS - LumaFusion</strong></p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumafusion/id1062022008?mt=8" >LumaFusion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a powerful multi track video editor which has been built for the mobile marketplace. It’s widely used by professional filmmakers and journalists, which is why we’ve picked it as one of the best alternatives to Premier Rush for iOS users.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p> It’s not the easiest app to get started with, but the creators have made a ton of tutorial videos to help you get to grips with it. Capability wise, it’s amazing, with up to three tracks for photos, videos, graphic and titles as well as an additional three audio tracks for narration, music and sound effects.</p>
<p> Video editing includes a wealth of special effects, from color correction tools to transitions, as well as an audio track mixer which can be adjusted on the fly. Title pages can be created, as well as adapting the speed and ratio of playback. Sharing the finished project can be done via social media, cloud storage, disk storage and more.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p> It’s great to see more software like Adobe Rush coming onto the market; however, it’s important to realize that, despite the hype, there may still be drawbacks to some of these systems. For us, Adobe Rush was exactly that something for editing videos in a rush. If you’re serious about making awesome clips though, investigating some of these alternatives to Adobe Rush.</p>
<p> Before you shell out the high subscription price for Adobe products, it’s worth considering what you really want from your software. Having some goals in mind will allow you to compare the different alternatives to Premier Rush to see where the best value for money lies.</p>

<p> Adobe have recently released their new multi-platform video editing tool named <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html" >Adobe Rush <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It promises to be the first of its type in the world, allowing hassle video editing and publishing to a multitude of platforms.</p>

<p> Dubbed the video editing tool for the YouTube generation, having been designed from the ground up for online video creators. Editing is simple via its suite of audio and visual tools, including title screens, transition effects and color adjustment tools. Export is optimized for all social platforms available, including Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat.</p>
<p> Despite the promise of the perfect video editing tool, it’s not been entirely warmly received. Some complain that the editing tools are just too basic, others that the price is uncompetitive. Other issues have been raised with slow rendering capabilities and general instability of the platform, causing crashes that can set projects back by hours.</p>
<p> We’re going to take a look at some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush out there, which may be more capable of getting the job done.</p>

<p> Windows users will need to be upgraded to the latest version of the operating system, at least version 1709 as a minimum. You’ll also need at least 8GB of RAM if you want to avoid the system crashing every time you use it.</p>
<p> Despite having computers that meet the required spec, numerous users have complained that Adobe Rush is buggy and repeatedly crashes. Some say that the laggy performance makes it almost impossible to use.</p>
<p> An alternative is to use Rush on your iPhone, but for this you’ll need to own at least an iPhone 7, preferably something newer. In testing, we found it to be very slow, even on an iPhone X. If you’re an Android user, you’ll need to wait to experience the ‘Rush’, because this software is not available for your handset yet. Adobe have said they are working on it and how to have it ready at some point in 2019.</p>
<h4 id="Performance-3"><a href="#Performance-3" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h4><p> As a video editing tool, it’s fairly competent, but for anything more than the basics, it’s somewhat lacking. Many of the most basic video editing tools are missing, and the platform supports only three transitions, so if you’re into making longer or more complex videos, its just not going to work.</p>
<p> In terms of rendering, we found it incredibly slow in comparison to some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush. The background music choices are pretty limited too, and most of it is not what you want accompanying your cutting-edge videos.</p>
<p> What really broke the deal for us was the inability to specify the output of your video files. This means that although social sharing could be OK, you’re going to be stuck if you want to share it in other locations. It’s great to see a video editing app on iPhone, but overall, it’s really nothing special.</p>
<h4 id="Price-3"><a href="#Price-3" class="headerlink" title="Price"></a>Price</h4><p> If you already subscribe to the Adobe Create Cloud (CC) suite, then Rush will be included in your subscription. However, if you want to subscribe to it as a standalone app, the price is $9.99 a month for individuals. This is not particularly competitive with the alternatives to Premier Rush, and could be prohibitively expensive for the hobbyist, which is, after all, the market Adobe are aiming at.</p>
<h2 id="Alternatives-to-Adobe-Rush-for-All-Platforms-3"><a href="#Alternatives-to-Adobe-Rush-for-All-Platforms-3" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to Adobe Rush for All Platforms"></a>Alternatives to Adobe Rush for All Platforms</h2><p> While Adobe are marketing Rush as a ‘cross platform’ video editor, there are alternatives to Premier Rush which do the job just as well, if not better, and often for a lot less.</p>
<p><strong>1. For Windows - Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p> We love <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as an alternative to Adobe Rush for Windows. Unlike Rush, you can pick and choose your video output format, as Filmora is compatible with all major video file types including mp4, FLV, MKV, AVI, MOV and more. Instead of being limited to a handful of basic effects, Filmora supports more than <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://effects.wondershare.com/" >300 high performance effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and filters to perfect your visual appeal.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-btn-win.jpg"
                      alt="Download Win Version"
                ></a><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p>
<p> As well as being a video editor, Filmora is a working audio editor too, featuring a full mixer and equalizer to bring your music and speech to life. There’re no transitional limitations, and you can even use green-screen technology, tilt-shift and jump cut features to make your videos pop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-rush-alternatives-filmora-9.jpg"
                     
                ></p>
<p> Each video can use up to 99 timelines to make it easier to edit and customize your work. Finally, and a big plus for many of us, you don’t need to have the latest and best PC in order to use this software. Wondershare Filmora works on Windows 7, 8 and 10, and requires only 3GB of RAM. If you want to work in HD or 4K quality, however, you will need 8GB RAM.</p>
<p><strong>2. For Mac - iMovie</strong></p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a powerful editing tool designed for iOS and perfect to use on a Mac. Using your own photos and videos, you can create polished movies complete with titles and even a credits roll. It’s great for turning memories into beautiful keepsakes, which can then be shared with family and friends via social media or direct from your Apple device.</p>

                ></p>
<p> The user-friendly interface makes it possible for even the most novice of users to harness the power of digital video editing. Complete with templates and easy to use tools, even beginners can make high quality trailers, logos and cinema like productions.</p>
<p> iMovie lets users access a number of special effects and enhancements, as well as ten filters to improve the images. Music can be chosen from their own library, and narrative voice overs are possible too. We think iMovie is one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush available for Mac.</p>
<p><strong>3. For Android - Filmora</strong></p>
<p> As Rush is not yet available for the Android platform, users must look for alternatives to Premier Rush if they want to go ahead and start making movies. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great solution, as powerful as most of the desktop editors you’ll come across and with all the features you need to get started.</p>
<p> Clips can be selected from your own device, or from Facebook or Google, and then added into your project folder to be created into a movie. They can then be arranged into a handy timeline, using simple drag and drop functionality which is easy for even beginners to master. There are even in-built themes which you can try out to turn your home movies into something special.</p>
<p> For switching between stills or video clips, there are a raft of fun transitions available to make it a more cohesive production. You can adjust colors, brightness, speed and more, as well as adding in subtitles and editing in music. One of the best features of this software is the picture-in-picture function, where you can add another video or still over the main one. It’s free and amazing fun, and we think one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush for Android.</p>
<p><strong>4. For iOS - LumaFusion</strong></p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumafusion/id1062022008?mt=8" >LumaFusion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a powerful multi track video editor which has been built for the mobile marketplace. It’s widely used by professional filmmakers and journalists, which is why we’ve picked it as one of the best alternatives to Premier Rush for iOS users.</p>

<p>We’ve picked out some of the best <strong>audio converters</strong> available right now based on several different factors</p>
<p>You’ll be able to see for yourself just how good each audio converter actually is.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Convert-Audio"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Convert-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Convert Audio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>How to Convert Audio?</strong></h2><p>Before we start listing the best <strong>audio converters</strong> down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an <strong>audio converter</strong>! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!</strong></p>
<p>The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The <strong>free audio converter</strong> that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual ‘launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Launch Audio Converter"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Audio File!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to ‘Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the ‘UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%202.png"
                      alt="Upload Audio for Conversion"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Select Audio File Output Format"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Start Conversion!</strong></p>
<p>Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting ‘CONVERT’.</p>

                      alt="Start conversion"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download or Save File!</strong></p>
<p>Once the conversion has been completed, your <strong>audio converter</strong> will either give you an option to ‘DOWNLOAD’ or ‘SAVE’ the finished product to your device!</p>

We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software"><a href="#Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Essential Features of Audio Converter Software"></a>Part 3 <strong>Essential Features of Audio Converter Software</strong></h2><p>There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best <strong>audio converter</strong> software for them:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Input Formats and Output Formats</strong>: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Conversion Speed</strong>: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Bonus Features</strong>: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-What’s-the-Best-Free-Audio-Converter-Software-Programs"><a href="#Part-4-What’s-the-Best-Free-Audio-Converter-Software-Programs" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 What’s the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs"></a>Part 4 <strong>What’s the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs</strong></h2><p>Now to get to our list of the best <strong>free audio converter</strong> software available! We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best <strong>audio converter</strong> for each type of user…</p>
<h3 id="01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="01**Wondershare Filmora Video Editor**"></a>01**<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>**</h3><p><strong>Supported OS:</strong> Windows&#x2F;Mac</p>
<p><strong>Supported Input:</strong> MP3, M4A, WAV, AIFF, OGG, WMA, AIF</p>
<p><strong>Supported Output:</strong> MP3, M4A, WAV, AIFF, OGG, WMA, AIF</p>
<p><strong>CNET Rating:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on this list is Filmora Pro! Filmora Pro is not necessarily an audio converter, since it’s capable of doing so much more than that. But it earned a spot on this list anyway because it has audio converting features! We recommend this for users who want an ‘All-in-One’ tool! One that will not only allow them to convert a variety of audio but also give them the ability to protect their projects with advanced video editing functions.</p>

There are just too many of them! No one has the time to go and test each and every single one of them! (Aside from us!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fortunately, in terms of features, there are really only three that you have to think about: speed, flexibility, and bonus features.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The abundance of choices at least makes sure that each <strong>audio auditor</strong> is able to meet the specific needs of a certain group of users! To imitate this fact, our list of <strong>audio converters</strong> was compiled specifically so that we could offer as much variety as possible. With hints along the way to make sure that everyone has an audio converter that suits their own projects.</p>

<p>We’ve picked out some of the best <strong>audio converters</strong> available right now based on several different factors</p>
<p>You’ll be able to see for yourself just how good each audio converter actually is.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Convert-Audio-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Convert-Audio-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Convert Audio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>How to Convert Audio?</strong></h2><p>Before we start listing the best <strong>audio converters</strong> down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an <strong>audio converter</strong>! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!</strong></p>
<p>The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The <strong>free audio converter</strong> that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual ‘launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Launch Audio Converter"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Audio File!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to ‘Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the ‘UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Audio for Conversion"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Select Audio File Output Format"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Start Conversion!</strong></p>
<p>Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting ‘CONVERT’.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download or Save File!</strong></p>
<p>Once the conversion has been completed, your <strong>audio converter</strong> will either give you an option to ‘DOWNLOAD’ or ‘SAVE’ the finished product to your device!</p>

We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software-1"><a href="#Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Essential Features of Audio Converter Software"></a>Part 3 <strong>Essential Features of Audio Converter Software</strong></h2><p>There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best <strong>audio converter</strong> software for them:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Input Formats and Output Formats</strong>: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Conversion Speed</strong>: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Bonus Features</strong>: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!</p>

<p><strong>CNET Rating:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on this list is Filmora Pro! Filmora Pro is not necessarily an audio converter, since it’s capable of doing so much more than that. But it earned a spot on this list anyway because it has audio converting features! We recommend this for users who want an ‘All-in-One’ tool! One that will not only allow them to convert a variety of audio but also give them the ability to protect their projects with advanced video editing functions.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, MediaHuman is a very simple and clean audio converter. That makes it incredibly easy to use, and quite convenient to just pick up.</p>

<p>We’ve picked out some of the best <strong>audio converters</strong> available right now based on several different factors</p>
<p>You’ll be able to see for yourself just how good each audio converter actually is.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Convert-Audio-2"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Convert-Audio-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Convert Audio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>How to Convert Audio?</strong></h2><p>Before we start listing the best <strong>audio converters</strong> down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an <strong>audio converter</strong>! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!</strong></p>
<p>The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The <strong>free audio converter</strong> that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual ‘launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Launch Audio Converter"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Audio File!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to ‘Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the ‘UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%202.png"
                      alt="Upload Audio for Conversion"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Select Audio File Output Format"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Start Conversion!</strong></p>
<p>Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting ‘CONVERT’.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download or Save File!</strong></p>
<p>Once the conversion has been completed, your <strong>audio converter</strong> will either give you an option to ‘DOWNLOAD’ or ‘SAVE’ the finished product to your device!</p>

We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software-2"><a href="#Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Essential Features of Audio Converter Software"></a>Part 3 <strong>Essential Features of Audio Converter Software</strong></h2><p>There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best <strong>audio converter</strong> software for them:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Input Formats and Output Formats</strong>: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Conversion Speed</strong>: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Bonus Features</strong>: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!</p>

We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best <strong>audio converter</strong> for each type of user…</p>

<p><strong>CNET Rating:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on this list is Filmora Pro! Filmora Pro is not necessarily an audio converter, since it’s capable of doing so much more than that. But it earned a spot on this list anyway because it has audio converting features! We recommend this for users who want an ‘All-in-One’ tool! One that will not only allow them to convert a variety of audio but also give them the ability to protect their projects with advanced video editing functions.</p>

<p>For the next item on our list, we have EaseUs Video Converter! If Filmora Pro is the jack of all trades, EaseUs Video Converter is the master of its trade. As a converter true and true, it is capable of more advanced conversions. Case in point, the software supports over 300 audio formats (including some of the obscure ones!) It also offers basic video and audio editing for perfecting projects!</p>

<p>The next general step is to ‘Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the ‘UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Start Conversion!</strong></p>
<p>Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting ‘CONVERT’.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Input Formats and Output Formats</strong>: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Conversion Speed</strong>: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Bonus Features</strong>: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!</p>

<p>The first of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on this list is Filmora Pro! Filmora Pro is not necessarily an audio converter, since it’s capable of doing so much more than that. But it earned a spot on this list anyway because it has audio converting features! We recommend this for users who want an ‘All-in-One’ tool! One that will not only allow them to convert a variety of audio but also give them the ability to protect their projects with advanced video editing functions.</p>

<p><em>Is there a way to trim VLC without losing quality?</em> Of course! Trimming VLC videos without losing quality can be a bit frustrating sometimes. Fortunately, there are applications available that can help you edit videos without losing quality. Wondershare Filmora is one such software that can be downloaded for free. You cannot miss it.</p>
<p>In this article, we will introduce why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality, then recommend 3 video editors trim high-quality video without lowering the quality.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#why-trim-vlc-loss-quality">Section 1. Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality</a></li>
<li><a href="#software-trim-vlc-without-loss-quality">Section 2. Video editor to trim VLC videos without loss of quality</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Section-1-Why-trimming-VLC-videos-will-result-in-loss-of-quality"><a href="#Section-1-Why-trimming-VLC-videos-will-result-in-loss-of-quality" class="headerlink" title="Section 1.  Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality?"></a>Section 1.  Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality?</h2><p>To understand quality loss, you first need to understand codecs, containers, and video re-encoding. This might get a little technical, so keep sipping that coffee!</p>
<h4 id="1-Codec"><a href="#1-Codec" class="headerlink" title="1. Codec"></a>1. Codec</h4><p>Every video has a codec and a container associated with it. A video codec is an order in which the video data is organized for playback, editing, and other functions. There are lots of different types of codecs, and each of them has different functions and advantages.</p>
<h4 id="2-Container"><a href="#2-Container" class="headerlink" title="2. Container"></a>2. Container</h4><p>A container is responsible for holding video data and other information in a single file. Containers have file extensions like .mp4, .avi, .mov, etc. Some containers can only hold videos in one specific codec, while others can hold multiple codecs. Containers are also responsible for telling media players whether a video has audio or not.</p>
<p>Why are codecs and containers so important? Imagine if you watched a 1080p video (codec) on an old TV (container) – it would work, but would you really be interested in seeing it? Probably not. A mismatch between containers and codecs can result in poor quality, which is why you must shoot your videos in the right format and play them on the right platform.</p>
<h4 id="3-Video-compression-and-re-encoding"><a href="#3-Video-compression-and-re-encoding" class="headerlink" title="3. Video compression and re-encoding"></a>3. Video compression and re-encoding</h4><p>You might be wondering at what point of the whole process does the video loses quality. When you capture the video, it is of the highest quality. As soon as you compress it to share it online, some quality loss occurs, even if you convert it into a high-quality video.</p>
<p>When you export a video that’s already been exported, you re-encode the video. <strong>Re-encoding a VLC video can result in even more quality loss.</strong></p>
<p>The truth is, you can’t reduce the video size without losing quality no matter what you do. If you’re editing a video shot in 4K, but you export it in 720p, the video will become compressed, and the original data of the video won’t get transferred to the new video, resulting in a pixelated block of mess.</p>
<p>When you make changes to a video with a <strong>video trimmer app</strong>, you’re changing the data structure that holds information about the video. Why do VLC videos that are small in size appear pixelated and blurry? It’s because they don’t have as much information as videos with larger sizes.</p>

Trimming VLC through LosslessCut</h3><p>LosslessCut is an open-source video cutter that runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac. Like Filmora, this software also allows you to cut videos without re-encoding, so there is no loss of quality. It is user-friendlier than Filmora – all you have to do is drag your video to the software and then you can start trimming it by using the Arrow symbols.</p>

<p>One unique feature of LosslessCut is that it lets you take JPEG screenshots of the video. It also has a portable version that doesn’t require any installation and can be started directly from a USB.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: LosslessCut works best with mobile videos or action cams like GoPro.</li>
<li>Cons: It supports a whole range of video formats, but don’t expect to edit 4K videos using this software. It’s simple and easy to use for a reason.</li>
</ul>

Unlike Filmora and LosslessCut, TunesKit supports a very limited number of video formats. It is mainly an MP4 video cutter. It works at a much faster speed and there is no loss of quality.</p>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: The interface, while simpler than Filmora’s, can seem a bit confusing sometimes. TunesKit also has a video editor, which lets you add effects to different segments of the trimmed video, a feature that you probably won’t be using very often. To trim VLC videos in MP4 without re-encoding, you simply have to drag the slider that appears when you import your video.</li>
<li>Cons: However, its functions may not be as rich as Filmora.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>If you trim your VLC video, it will result in data loss, which will lead to a reduction in quality. Losing quality is inevitable with most video editors, which is why you should <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Download Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as it’s easy to use and has the best and most useful features.</p>
<p>Filmora supports many popular formats like MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, and also different screen resolutions so no matter what the format of your VLC video is, you can easily divide it by scenes using the Scene Detection feature and quickly turn those scenes into clips.</p>

<p><em>Is there a way to trim VLC without losing quality?</em> Of course! Trimming VLC videos without losing quality can be a bit frustrating sometimes. Fortunately, there are applications available that can help you edit videos without losing quality. Wondershare Filmora is one such software that can be downloaded for free. You cannot miss it.</p>
<p>In this article, we will introduce why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality, then recommend 3 video editors trim high-quality video without lowering the quality.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#why-trim-vlc-loss-quality">Section 1. Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality</a></li>
<li><a href="#software-trim-vlc-without-loss-quality">Section 2. Video editor to trim VLC videos without loss of quality</a></li>

Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality?"></a>Section 1.  Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality?</h2><p>To understand quality loss, you first need to understand codecs, containers, and video re-encoding. This might get a little technical, so keep sipping that coffee!</p>
<h4 id="1-Codec-1"><a href="#1-Codec-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Codec"></a>1. Codec</h4><p>Every video has a codec and a container associated with it. A video codec is an order in which the video data is organized for playback, editing, and other functions. There are lots of different types of codecs, and each of them has different functions and advantages.</p>
<h4 id="2-Container-1"><a href="#2-Container-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Container"></a>2. Container</h4><p>A container is responsible for holding video data and other information in a single file. Containers have file extensions like .mp4, .avi, .mov, etc. Some containers can only hold videos in one specific codec, while others can hold multiple codecs. Containers are also responsible for telling media players whether a video has audio or not.</p>
<p>Why are codecs and containers so important? Imagine if you watched a 1080p video (codec) on an old TV (container) – it would work, but would you really be interested in seeing it? Probably not. A mismatch between containers and codecs can result in poor quality, which is why you must shoot your videos in the right format and play them on the right platform.</p>
<h4 id="3-Video-compression-and-re-encoding-1"><a href="#3-Video-compression-and-re-encoding-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Video compression and re-encoding"></a>3. Video compression and re-encoding</h4><p>You might be wondering at what point of the whole process does the video loses quality. When you capture the video, it is of the highest quality. As soon as you compress it to share it online, some quality loss occurs, even if you convert it into a high-quality video.</p>
<p>When you export a video that’s already been exported, you re-encode the video. <strong>Re-encoding a VLC video can result in even more quality loss.</strong></p>
<p>The truth is, you can’t reduce the video size without losing quality no matter what you do. If you’re editing a video shot in 4K, but you export it in 720p, the video will become compressed, and the original data of the video won’t get transferred to the new video, resulting in a pixelated block of mess.</p>
<p>When you make changes to a video with a <strong>video trimmer app</strong>, you’re changing the data structure that holds information about the video. Why do VLC videos that are small in size appear pixelated and blurry? It’s because they don’t have as much information as videos with larger sizes.</p>

Filmora supports pretty much every video format there is, so you don’t have to worry about codecs and containers.</p>
<p>If you’re working with a long video, you can take advantage of Filmora unique feature called “Scene Detection.” With this feature, the software will automatically detect scene changes in the VLC video and separate them, making it easy for you to trim it into multiple clips.

Trimming VLC through LosslessCut</h3><p>LosslessCut is an open-source video cutter that runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac. Like Filmora, this software also allows you to cut videos without re-encoding, so there is no loss of quality. It is user-friendlier than Filmora – all you have to do is drag your video to the software and then you can start trimming it by using the Arrow symbols.</p>

<li>Cons: However, its functions may not be as rich as Filmora.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Conclusion-6"><a href="#Conclusion-6" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>If you trim your VLC video, it will result in data loss, which will lead to a reduction in quality. Losing quality is inevitable with most video editors, which is why you should <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Download Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as it’s easy to use and has the best and most useful features.</p>
<p>Filmora supports many popular formats like MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, and also different screen resolutions so no matter what the format of your VLC video is, you can easily divide it by scenes using the Scene Detection feature and quickly turn those scenes into clips.</p>

<p><em>Is there a way to trim VLC without losing quality?</em> Of course! Trimming VLC videos without losing quality can be a bit frustrating sometimes. Fortunately, there are applications available that can help you edit videos without losing quality. Wondershare Filmora is one such software that can be downloaded for free. You cannot miss it.</p>
<p>In this article, we will introduce why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality, then recommend 3 video editors trim high-quality video without lowering the quality.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#why-trim-vlc-loss-quality">Section 1. Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality</a></li>
<li><a href="#software-trim-vlc-without-loss-quality">Section 2. Video editor to trim VLC videos without loss of quality</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Section-1-Why-trimming-VLC-videos-will-result-in-loss-of-quality-3"><a href="#Section-1-Why-trimming-VLC-videos-will-result-in-loss-of-quality-3" class="headerlink" title="Section 1.  Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality?"></a>Section 1.  Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality?</h2><p>To understand quality loss, you first need to understand codecs, containers, and video re-encoding. This might get a little technical, so keep sipping that coffee!</p>
<h4 id="1-Codec-3"><a href="#1-Codec-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Codec"></a>1. Codec</h4><p>Every video has a codec and a container associated with it. A video codec is an order in which the video data is organized for playback, editing, and other functions. There are lots of different types of codecs, and each of them has different functions and advantages.</p>
<h4 id="2-Container-3"><a href="#2-Container-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Container"></a>2. Container</h4><p>A container is responsible for holding video data and other information in a single file. Containers have file extensions like .mp4, .avi, .mov, etc. Some containers can only hold videos in one specific codec, while others can hold multiple codecs. Containers are also responsible for telling media players whether a video has audio or not.</p>
<p>Why are codecs and containers so important? Imagine if you watched a 1080p video (codec) on an old TV (container) – it would work, but would you really be interested in seeing it? Probably not. A mismatch between containers and codecs can result in poor quality, which is why you must shoot your videos in the right format and play them on the right platform.</p>
<h4 id="3-Video-compression-and-re-encoding-3"><a href="#3-Video-compression-and-re-encoding-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Video compression and re-encoding"></a>3. Video compression and re-encoding</h4><p>You might be wondering at what point of the whole process does the video loses quality. When you capture the video, it is of the highest quality. As soon as you compress it to share it online, some quality loss occurs, even if you convert it into a high-quality video.</p>
<p>When you export a video that’s already been exported, you re-encode the video. <strong>Re-encoding a VLC video can result in even more quality loss.</strong></p>
<p>The truth is, you can’t reduce the video size without losing quality no matter what you do. If you’re editing a video shot in 4K, but you export it in 720p, the video will become compressed, and the original data of the video won’t get transferred to the new video, resulting in a pixelated block of mess.</p>
<p>When you make changes to a video with a <strong>video trimmer app</strong>, you’re changing the data structure that holds information about the video. Why do VLC videos that are small in size appear pixelated and blurry? It’s because they don’t have as much information as videos with larger sizes.</p>
