<p>Premiere Pro CC is another desktop video editor that you can use to brighten your videos. The various parameters in the Lumetri Color panel window inside Premiere Pro CC may be used to accomplish video color correction.</p>
<p>Premiere Pro’s Lumetri Color Tools elevate the application to the level of Photoshop for video. These tools provide a surprising amount of color modification and a wide range of film and HDR effects. With keyframes, you may modify the white balance, exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, and black point, among other things. Modifications for Saturation, Vibrance, Faded Film and Sharpen are also accessible.</p>
<h3 id="5-Final-Cut-Pro-3"><a href="#5-Final-Cut-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Final Cut Pro"></a>5. Final Cut Pro</h3><p>Final Cut Pro comes with a set of robust manual color correction features that can be used to achieve a wide range of color correction and enhancement features. Creating a color correction effect and then modifying the effect’s settings in the Color inspector is how you utilize the tools. Any of the following color correction effects may be used to make manual color modifications to the color tint, brightness, and contrast of the entire clip picture.</p>
<p>Color correction capabilities in Final Cut Pro allow you to fine-tune the look of any video in your project, including still photos, by adjusting color balance, shadow levels, mid-tone thresholds, highlight levels, and much more. Saturation, exposure, and color modifications are all controlled via the Color Board. Adjust the Brightness in the color adjustment panels to brighten your movies.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Adjusting brightness has become a “small problem” for many. Oftentimes, you record a video, and it falls short of the brightness criteria – it’s too dark! However, when you have quality <strong>Video Brightness Editors</strong>, like the ones we have reviewed above, you’re in good hands. Not only are these apps easy to use with excellent functionality, but they also make editing a piece of cake for everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, iPhone, iPad</p>
<p>The process of making a reaction video in iMovie isn’t much different from the process of making any other type of video. Before you start working on your new reaction video, you need to make sure that you have all the media files you want you to use in your project. You can then simply import them into iMovie, and place footage of yourself reacting to a video to the timeline.

<p>However, the overlaid video is not going to be automatically visible in the preview screen, so you should just click on the Video Overlay Settings and pick the Picture in Picture option.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>Both the video of your reaction and the video to which you are reacting must be recorded before you start editing them in Sony Vegas Pro. Making a reaction video with this video editing software is a relatively easy task that only requires you to position your footage correctly on the timeline.</p>
<p>The video containing your reaction should be below the video you are commenting on so that the second video can be treated as an overlay. Click on the Event Pan&#x2F;Crop button and readjust the size and the on-screen location of the video you’re reacting to. When done, you can proceed to sync both videos so that your reactions correspond with the events in the other video. Don’t forget to preview the reaction video you’ve created before exporting it.</p>

<p>The process of making a reaction video in iMovie isn’t much different from the process of making any other type of video. Before you start working on your new reaction video, you need to make sure that you have all the media files you want you to use in your project. You can then simply import them into iMovie, and place footage of yourself reacting to a video to the timeline. Afterward, you should place the actual video to which you are reacting above or below the video file that contains the footage of your reaction, depending on which video clip you want to use as a background video.</p>
<p>However, the overlaid video is not going to be automatically visible in the preview screen, so you should just click on the Video Overlay Settings and pick the Picture in Picture option. As soon as you select this option the overlay video will become visible in the preview window, where you can adjust its size and position. When ready, you should export your reaction video and upload it to your channel.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The quick and easy video editing process</li>
<li>Available to all Mac users for free</li>
<li>Excellent for inexperienced video editors</li>
<li>A rich selection of visual effects</li>

Once the OBS’ main window loads, you just have to specify the sources from which you want to record the footage. Simply right-click anywhere within the Sources tab, select the Add option and choose the Display Capture setting from the submenu.</p>
<p>You can then repeat the same process to select Audio Output Capture option, in order to record the audio from the video you’re reacting to. Afterward, you should head over to the Add menu once more and add the Video Capture Device to the Sources tab. Optionally, you can readjust the size of each video source in the Preview Window, and hit the Start Recording button.</p>

<p>Both the video of your reaction and the video to which you are reacting must be recorded before you start editing them in Sony Vegas Pro. Making a reaction video with this video editing software is a relatively easy task that only requires you to position your footage correctly on the timeline.</p>
<p>The video containing your reaction should be below the video you are commenting on so that the second video can be treated as an overlay. Click on the Event Pan&#x2F;Crop button and readjust the size and the on-screen location of the video you’re reacting to. When done, you can proceed to sync both videos so that your reactions correspond with the events in the other video. Don’t forget to preview the reaction video you’ve created before exporting it.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Offers professional video editing tools</li>
<li>Grants users full control over the footage</li>

You should then place the footage on two separate video tracks on the timeline, and readjust the size of each video in the preview window.</p>

<p>Filmora lets you remove the background of the video clips you don’t want to include in the final cut with the human segmentation effect under AI Portrait. This feature allows you to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >separate people from the video background <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and replace them with a new one. And then you can blend the reaction video with the original one fluently. After you complete the video editing process you can export your project to your YouTube or Vimeo account directly from Filmora.</p>

<h3 id="2-VSDC-3"><a href="#2-VSDC-3" class="headerlink" title="2. VSDC"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.videosoftdev.com/" >VSDC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>In order to start making a reaction video with VSDC, you must first record your reaction to the video and make sure that the video you’re reacting to is saved on your computer’s hard drive. You should then create a new project in VSDC, specify the resolution for the entire project and proceed to import all media files you’re going to need during the video editing process, by selecting the Video option from the Add Object menu.</p>
<p>Place the files on the editor’s timeline so that they are positioned one above the other. The reaction video should occupy the full screen, and you can use the preview window to adjust the size of the reaction video. You should than readjust the on-screen position and the size of the video you’re reacting to, before proceeding to preview the resulting video. In case you like the result you should click on the Export button and choose the output file format and the destination to which the reaction video will be exported.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No previous video editing experience needed</li>
<li>Offers a rich selection of transitions and visual effects</li>
<li>Videos can be exported directly to YouTube from VSDC in resolutions up to 4K</li>
<li>Offers desktop capturing tools</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-iMovie-7"><a href="#3-iMovie-7" class="headerlink" title="3. iMovie"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, iPhone, iPad</p>
<p>The process of making a reaction video in iMovie isn’t much different from the process of making any other type of video. Before you start working on your new reaction video, you need to make sure that you have all the media files you want you to use in your project. You can then simply import them into iMovie, and place footage of yourself reacting to a video to the timeline. Afterward, you should place the actual video to which you are reacting above or below the video file that contains the footage of your reaction, depending on which video clip you want to use as a background video.</p>
<p>However, the overlaid video is not going to be automatically visible in the preview screen, so you should just click on the Video Overlay Settings and pick the Picture in Picture option. As soon as you select this option the overlay video will become visible in the preview window, where you can adjust its size and position. When ready, you should export your reaction video and upload it to your channel.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The quick and easy video editing process</li>
<li>Available to all Mac users for free</li>
<li>Excellent for inexperienced video editors</li>
<li>A rich selection of visual effects</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<h3 id="4-OBS-3"><a href="#4-OBS-3" class="headerlink" title="4. OBS"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, Linux</p>
<p>OBS is a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screencasting software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that enables you to create live streams or record all actions you perform on your computer’s screen. After you launch OBS, you should select the For Recording option, and this reaction video maker will optimize the project settings automatically. Once the OBS’ main window loads, you just have to specify the sources from which you want to record the footage. Simply right-click anywhere within the Sources tab, select the Add option and choose the Display Capture setting from the submenu.</p>
<p>You can then repeat the same process to select Audio Output Capture option, in order to record the audio from the video you’re reacting to. Afterward, you should head over to the Add menu once more and add the Video Capture Device to the Sources tab. Optionally, you can readjust the size of each video source in the Preview Window, and hit the Start Recording button.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Free for PC and Mac users</li>
<li>Enables users to specify the format of the output video</li>
<li>Captures videos in HD resolution</li>
<li>Excellent audio recording features</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>Both the video of your reaction and the video to which you are reacting must be recorded before you start editing them in Sony Vegas Pro. Making a reaction video with this video editing software is a relatively easy task that only requires you to position your footage correctly on the timeline.</p>
<p>The video containing your reaction should be below the video you are commenting on so that the second video can be treated as an overlay. Click on the Event Pan&#x2F;Crop button and readjust the size and the on-screen location of the video you’re reacting to. When done, you can proceed to sync both videos so that your reactions correspond with the events in the other video. Don’t forget to preview the reaction video you’ve created before exporting it.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Offers professional video editing tools</li>
<li>Grants users full control over the footage</li>
<li>Intuitive and modernly designed interface</li>
<li>Supports a broad range of output file formats</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Aimed only at professional video editors</li>
<li>Capturing a computer screen with Sony Vegas Pro is not possible</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In order to gather thousands of views, comments, and likes, every detail in your reaction videos needs to be perfect. Video reaction makers we featured in this article enable you to have complete creative control over the process of making a reaction video.</p>
<p>Among all these above, if you want to go for a free one, I’ll say you should go for <strong>OBS.</strong></p>
<p>If you want to go for a paid one but don’t want to pay too much for it, I’ll suggest you go for <strong>Filmora</strong>, which provides you several ways to create a reaction video easily on Windows and Mac.</p>
