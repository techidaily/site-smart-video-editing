<p>The audio and video out of sync is a common issue faced by most Final Cut Pro X users. They experience an audio delay in their edited video that gives a bad impression and haunts the user experience.</p>
<p>Whenever you face an out-of-sync problem, don’t assume that the clips in your sequence are also out of sync. Multiple factors can cause sync issues, the most prominent one is by an over-taxing of the processor when it tries to run the program at its maximum. Consequently, the overstressed processer fails to sync audio and video accordingly and causes a delay.</p>

Its auto-sync feature automatically analyzes the audio and video clips selected in your timeline and allows you to sync video with audio.</p>
<p>To use this feature, use multiple audio and video clips recorded from different resources during the same take. Once you have selected, Final Cut Pro will automatically start analyzing the clips for sync points like date of file creation, markers, audio content, and time code, etc. After analyzing the clips, the syncing process will begin in which these audio and video clips will be synced together into a new clip without affecting the original clip. Even if your clips do not have any sync points, Final Cut Pro X will sync them at their respective starting points.</p>

<p>The audio and video out of sync is a common issue faced by most Final Cut Pro X users. They experience an audio delay in their edited video that gives a bad impression and haunts the user experience.</p>
<p>Whenever you face an out-of-sync problem, don’t assume that the clips in your sequence are also out of sync. Multiple factors can cause sync issues, the most prominent one is by an over-taxing of the processor when it tries to run the program at its maximum. Consequently, the overstressed processer fails to sync audio and video accordingly and causes a delay.</p>

Its auto-sync feature automatically analyzes the audio and video clips selected in your timeline and allows you to sync video with audio.</p>
<p>To use this feature, use multiple audio and video clips recorded from different resources during the same take. Once you have selected, Final Cut Pro will automatically start analyzing the clips for sync points like date of file creation, markers, audio content, and time code, etc. After analyzing the clips, the syncing process will begin in which these audio and video clips will be synced together into a new clip without affecting the original clip. Even if your clips do not have any sync points, Final Cut Pro X will sync them at their respective starting points.</p>

<p>Users can also use custom settings for an advanced syncing process by adjusting different parameters according to their preferences. The following section explains the manual syncing process of audio and video clips in Final Cut Pro X.</p>
<p>This way, you can sync Multicam using audio in the Final Cut Pro X. To verify or adjust the sync, open the Multicam clip in the Angle Editor and drag it to the left or right. For single-frame adjustment, you can use the comma&#x2F;period keys, while the left&#x2F;right angle bracket is used for 10-frame adjustments.</p>

You can make Multicam clips with diverse media sources and include as many clips in any given angle as you want. Make sure you have labeled your clips with a camera name or an angle to make Final Cut Pro X sync Multicam properly. You can even name all the clips shot by one camera in a single step.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to create Multicam clips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create unique folders and put all clips from each camera in these folders separately.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Preferences &gt; Import &gt; Keywords</strong> and set the Finder Tags to label the imported clips and set the shots apart from the filenames.</li>
<li>In the FCPX menu, go to <strong>View &gt; Browser &gt; Toggle Filmstrip&#x2F;List View</strong> for setting the Event Browser to List View. (You can also use the command OPT+CMD+2).</li>
<li>If some of your clips have an incorrect time of day, you should adjust them first. Hence, select those clips and click <strong>Modify &gt; Adjust Content Created Date and Time.</strong></li>
<li>In the Event Browser, select multiple clips captured with one camera or audio recorder.</li>
<li>Press CMD+4 to show the Inspector, click the “i” button, and verify the clip’s information like camera name, etc.</li>
<li>Give a specific camera name to the selected clips and press return and repeat the process for each audio recorder and camera.</li>
<li>In the Event Browser, select multiple clips that need to be synced. Right-click on these clips and select the “Synchronize Clips” or “New Multicam Clip” option.</li>
<li>Click the checkbox “Use Audio for Synchronization” to sync audio.</li>
</ul>
<p>This way, you can sync Multicam using audio in the Final Cut Pro X. To verify or adjust the sync, open the Multicam clip in the Angle Editor and drag it to the left or right. For single-frame adjustment, you can use the comma&#x2F;period keys, while the left&#x2F;right angle bracket is used for 10-frame adjustments.</p>

The platform has various tools that provide you with different ways to make engaging lyric videos. Below are the summarized steps of creating a professional lyric video in Wondershare Filmora video editor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add and edit music in the timeline</strong></p>
<p>Since we are going to make a lyric video, let’s import the audio track to the timeline first, add the fade-in or fade-out effect to make it smoother if needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-filmora-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="Add music to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>2: Choose Sample Color background</strong></p>
<p>After launching Filmora, go to the Sample Color category under the Media tab, and you will find many sample colors to choose from. Drag and drop one into the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-sample-color-library.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora sample color library"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Add and customize texts to the lyric video</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor offers a wide variety of pre-written content and lets the creators drag and drop to see how it looks, with no need for editing or other typical copywriting tasks. Go to the Titles tab, drag the desired text over to the sample color video track. Here, we prefer to use a default title</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-lyric-titles-filmora.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora customize lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>Double click the titles in the timeline to customize the texts, fonts, colors, or animations. Click the Advanced button for a new window pops up where you can add a title box and do more customization. Such as giving the titles individual animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add effects for texts</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-mild-effects-to-lyric-video.jpg"
                      alt=" add mile effects to  lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>To make the whole title dynamic, we can add some effects to the texts. Go to the Effects tab and then click on mild effects to put the mild effects to the text. Right-click the Mild effect and go to Properties to change its frequency and positions if needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step</strong> <strong>5: Add</strong> <strong>transitions to texts</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor provides lots of transitions for playing the video smoother. Go to the Transitions tab and choose one and place it between each title to make the lyric video vivid.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

The platform has various tools that provide you with different ways to make engaging lyric videos. Below are the summarized steps of creating a professional lyric video in Wondershare Filmora video editor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add and edit music in the timeline</strong></p>
<p>Since we are going to make a lyric video, let’s import the audio track to the timeline first, add the fade-in or fade-out effect to make it smoother if needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-filmora-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="Add music to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>2: Choose Sample Color background</strong></p>
<p>After launching Filmora, go to the Sample Color category under the Media tab, and you will find many sample colors to choose from. Drag and drop one into the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-sample-color-library.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora sample color library"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Add and customize texts to the lyric video</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor offers a wide variety of pre-written content and lets the creators drag and drop to see how it looks, with no need for editing or other typical copywriting tasks. Go to the Titles tab, drag the desired text over to the sample color video track. Here, we prefer to use a default title</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-lyric-titles-filmora.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora customize lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>Double click the titles in the timeline to customize the texts, fonts, colors, or animations. Click the Advanced button for a new window pops up where you can add a title box and do more customization. Such as giving the titles individual animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add effects for texts</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-mild-effects-to-lyric-video.jpg"
                      alt=" add mile effects to  lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>To make the whole title dynamic, we can add some effects to the texts. Go to the Effects tab and then click on mild effects to put the mild effects to the text. Right-click the Mild effect and go to Properties to change its frequency and positions if needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step</strong> <strong>5: Add</strong> <strong>transitions to texts</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor provides lots of transitions for playing the video smoother. Go to the Transitions tab and choose one and place it between each title to make the lyric video vivid.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><strong>Fonts</strong></p>
<p>A lyric video is all about fonts because the viewers are interested in reading the lyrics. So, you should select interesting fonts and should focus on font style, size, and color. The fonts should sync in with the video’s vibe so that the viewer can enjoy watching it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions&#x2F;Filters</strong></p>

The professionals can create creative and engaging lyric videos to grab the attention of their viewers</p>
<p>You can follow these tips to make good lyric videos:</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>
<p>You should make sure that there is 100% accuracy in the lyric video you are creating. If there are wrong lyrics on any of your lyric videos, your followers may not prefer watching your other lyric videos. So, double-check or triple-check the lyrics before sharing them with your fans.</p>
<p><strong>Theme&#x2F;Background</strong></p>
<p>You should pick an attractive theme for creating an engaging video. No doubt, a video having a central theme attracts the viewers a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Color</strong></p>
<p>You should select an efficient and eye-catching color scheme for your lyric video. That is because it is helpful in elevating the visual appeal of the video, which in turn gains the attention of the viewers.</p>
<p><strong>Fonts</strong></p>
<p>A lyric video is all about fonts because the viewers are interested in reading the lyrics. So, you should select interesting fonts and should focus on font style, size, and color. The fonts should sync in with the video’s vibe so that the viewer can enjoy watching it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions&#x2F;Filters</strong></p>
<p>You should use filters that could blend with the song’s vibe. Choose the transitions that look natural and appealing. Never bombard your video with too many transitions and filters.</p>
